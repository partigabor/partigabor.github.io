  abstract = {This study aims to illuminate the early trade of three aromatic spices – cloves, nutmeg, and mace – and to contextualize their spread and diffusion along the pre-modern Maritime Silk Road. The three spices come from two trees native to the Spice Islands and were exclusive to this region until the 18th century. After an overview of the Maritime Silk Road, its academic approaches, extent, and related resources, the paper discusses the spice trade and role of spices in history and early medicine. Then, the study tracks the commercial journey of these commodities, relying on written records from European, Arabic, and Chinese sources. Relevant texts include medicinal and pharmacognostic works, geographical and economic writings, as well as accounts from travellers and merchants. Spice names as unique cultural items are also considered, as the words in various languages and their underlying etymological information can shed light on the routes and methods of their dissemination. Finally, after reviewing the distribution of the spice names, an attempt will be made to map their early dispersal. In short, this study seeks to present the long journey of these spices by considering botanical and geographical realities, interpreting historical events, and reviewing linguistic evidence.},
