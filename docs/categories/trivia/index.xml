      <description>I have been drawing flags ever since I was a kid, and all my life I thought that the Grenadian flag has tiny little flame. Now, after spending 3 years on a PhD thesis about spices, I found out that the flag features an open nutmeg fruit (Myristica fragrans), for its important role in the island&amp;rsquo;s economy. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that neat.</description>

      <description>What is the .io domain name and why is it problematic?&#xD;Link to heading&#xD;Preferred by tech companies, the .io domain name does not actually refer to the input-output word pair (I/O) we all learned about in primary school. I still remember that IT teacher - Gyuri b√°csi - with the black mustache and white lab-coat trying to calm us down when the first Windows 98 PCs arrived. We suddenly got slapped in the face by the ever-accelerating pace of technology and subsequently forgot all our (very limited) MS-DOS skills.</description>
