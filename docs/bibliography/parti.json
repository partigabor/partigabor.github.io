The artificial mummification process started in the Fourth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom reached its peak in the New Kingdom. This review focuses on the usage of mummification materials such as Natron salt, Coniferous resin, Mastic, Myrrh, Beeswax, Bitumen, Cassia, Onions, Lichen, Henna and Gum Arabic in ancient Egypt to determine their effectiveness in the preservation of the body. For each material, the chemical formula, the history, and the role in the preservation of the body are presented. It is shown that natron salt was the most important material to desiccate a corpse, and that the vegetable materials mentioned above have anti-bacterial properties that protected the body from microbial attack.","author":[{"family":"Abdel-Maksoud","given":"Gomaa"},{"family":"El-Amin","given":"Abdel-Rahman"}],"citation-key":"abdel-maksoud_2011_review","container-title":"Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"129-150","title":"A review on the materials used during the mummification processes in ancient Egypt","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"aftel_2014_fragrant","abstract":"The 'Alice Waters of American natural perfume' (indieperfume.com) celebrates our most potent sense, through five rock stars of the fragrant world. Mandy Aftel is widely acclaimed as a trailblazer in natural perfumery. Over two decades of sourcing the finest aromatic ingredients from all over the world and creating artisanal fragrances, she has been an evangelist for the transformative power of scent. In Fragrant, through five major players in the epic of aroma, she explores the profound connection between our sense of smell and the appetites that move us, give us pleasure, make us fully alive. Cinnamon, queen of the Spice Route, touches our hunger for the unknown, the exotic, the luxurious. Mint, homegrown the world over, speaks to our affinity for the familiar, the native, the authentic. Frankincense, an ancient incense ingredient, taps into our longing for transcendence, while ambergris embodies our unquenchable curiosity. And exquisite jasmine exemplifies our yearning for beauty, both evanescent and enduring. In addition to providing a riveting initiation into the history, natural history, and philosophy of scent, Fragrant imparts the essentials of scent literacy and includes recipes for easy-to-make fragrances and edible, drinkable, and useful concoctions that reveal the imaginative possibilities of creating with'and reveling in'aroma.

  {"id":"ager_2022_scent","abstract":"Magic was a fundamental part of the Greco-Roman world. Curses, erotic spells, healing charms, divination, and other supernatural methods of trying to change the universe were everyday methods of coping with the difficulties of life in antiquity. While ancient magic is most often studied through texts like surviving Greco-Egyptian spellbooks and artifacts like lead curse tablets, for a Greek or Roman magician a ritual was a rich sensual experience full of unusual tastes, smells, textures, and sounds, bright colors, and sensations like fasting and sleeplessness. Greco-Roman magical rituals were particularly dominated by the sense of smell, both fragrant smells and foul odors. Ritual practitioners surrounded themselves with clouds of fragrant incense and perfume to create a sweet and inviting atmosphere for contact with the divine and to alter their own perceptions; they also used odors as an instrumental weapon to attack enemies and command the gods. Elsewhere, odiferous herbs were used equally as medical cures and magical ingredients. In literature, scent and magic became intertwined as metaphors, with fragrant spells representing the dangers of sensual perfumes and conversely, smells acting as a visceral way of envisioning the mysterious action of magic The Scent of Ancient Magic explores the complex interconnection of scent and magic in the Greco-Roman world between 800 BCE and CE 600, drawing on ancient literature and the modern study of the senses to examine the sensory depth and richness of ancient magic. Author Britta K. Ager looks at how ancient magicians used scents as part of their spells, to put themselves in the right mindset for an encounter with a god or to attack their enemies through scent. Ager also examines the magicians who appear in ancient fiction, like Medea and Circe, and the more metaphorical ways in which their spells are confused with perfumes and herbs. This book brings together recent scholarship on ancient magic from classical studies and on scent from the interdisciplinary field of sensory studies in order to examine how practicing ancient magicians used scents for ritual purposes, how scent and magic were conceptually related in ancient literature and culture, and how the assumption that strong scents convey powerful effects of various sorts was also found in related areas like ancient medical practices and normative religious ritual.","author":[{"family":"Ager","given":"Britta K."}],"call-number":"BF1591","citation-key":"ager_2022_scent","contributor":[{"literal":"Michigan Publishing (University of Michigan)"}],"event-place":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","ISBN":"978-0-472-22007-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"University of Michigan Press","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor, Michigan","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The scent of ancient magic","type":"book"},

Our experiments show that MusicLM outperforms previous systems both in audio quality and adherence to the text description. Moreover, we demonstrate that MusicLM can be conditioned on both text and a melody in that it can transform whistled and hummed melodies according to the style described in a text caption.

Importance of Qarābādhīn gradually increased and acquired an imperative status. The history of Qarābādhīn starts from Chiron, Aesculapius, Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen in Greco-Roman era. Many of early and medieval Islamic and Arab physicians play vital role and immense original contribution in this discipline and authored important and essential Qarābādhīn with systemic and scientific approaches. Although some of them could not reach the present day, many of the manuscripts can be found in various libraries across the world. Since the Arab Caliphates appreciated and patronized the fields of medicine acquired from Greeks and worked for its development, this period also known as “Greco-Arabic era”. In this work the evaluation of Qarābādhīn (particularly written in Arabic or Greek language) was done in historical and regulatory perspective particularly in Greek era and later on in Medieval Islamic era. The findings of the review indicate the importance and regulatory status of Qarābādhīn and provide information about it. It can be helpful to explore Qarābādhīn and related publications of Greek and Medieval Islamic Arabic period, which gives foundations for the present-day pharmacopeias.

He examines the movement of ideas, peoples, goods, technologies, arts, and cultures across into and out of Malaysia over the centuries. Interactions between Muslims and the local Malay population began as early as the eighth century, sustained by trade and the agency of Sufi as well as Arab, Indian, Persian, and Chinese scholars and missionaries. Aljunied looks at how Malay states and societies survived under colonial regimes that heightened racial and religious divisions, and how Muslims responded through violence as well as reformist movements. Although there have been tensions and skirmishes between Muslims and non-Muslims in Malaysia, they have learned in the main to co-exist harmoniously, creating a society comprising a variety of distinct populations.

  {"id":"allen_2002_devil","abstract":"Deliciously organized by the Seven Deadly Sins, here is a scintillating history of forbidden foods through the ages--and how these mouth-watering taboos have defined cultures around the world. From the lusciously tempting fruit in the Garden of Eden to the divine foie gras, Stewart Lee Allen engagingly illustrates that when a pleasure as primal as eating is criminalized, there is often an astonishing tale to tell. Among the foods thought to encourage Lust, the love apple (now known as the tomato) was thought to possess demonic spirits until the nineteenth century. The Gluttony \"course\" invites the reader to an ancient Roman dinner party where nearly every dish served--from poppy-crusted rodents to \"Trojan Pork\"--Was considered a crime against the state. While the vice known as Sloth introduces the sad story of \"The Lazy Root\" (the potato), whose popularity in Ireland led British moralists to claim that the Great Famine was God's way of punishing the Irish for eating a food that bred degeneracy and idleness. Filled with incredible food history and the author's travels to many of these exotic locales, In the Devil's Garden also features recipes like the matzo-ball stews outlawed by the Spanish Inquisition and the forbidden \"chocolate champagnes\" of the Aztecs. This is truly a delectable book that will be consumed by food lovers, culinary historians, amateur anthropologists, and armchair travelers alike. Bon app?tit!

Despite the fact that herbs are often little more than weeds, cultures around the globe have found hundreds of uses for them, employing them in everything from ancient medicines to savoury dishes. While much has been written on cooking and healing with herbs, little has been told about the history of the plants themselves and the incredible journeys they have made.

The holy Quranic text was revealed in pure Classical Arabic, which forms the basis of Arabic linguistic theory and which is well understood by the educated Arabic reader. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the distributional lexical semantics of the Quran's words in the light of similar texts (corpus) that are written in pure Classical Arabic. To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two corpora of Classical Arabic one is part of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology Arabic Corpus (KACST Arabic Corpus) and the other is the Classical Arabic Corpus (CAC) (Elewa, 2009). However, neither of the two corpora is adequate for our research the former does not cover many genres such as: Linguistics, Literature, Science, Sociology and Biography and it only contains 17+ million words, so it is not very large. While the latter is even smaller with only 5 million words. Therefore, we made an effort to carefully design and compose our own corpus bearing in mind that it should be large enough, balanced, and representative so that any result obtained from it can be generalized for Classical Arabic.

  {"id":"andrade_2004_company","abstract":"[When the Dutch arrived in East Asia in the early seventeenth century, they had trouble persuading Chinese officials to grant them trade privileges. Yet these same officials gave official titles to Chinese pirates as part of a \"summon and appease\" (zhaofu) policy in the hope that the pirates would abandon crime for more civilized pursuits. After a decade of frustrations, the Dutch decided to take a page from the pirates' playbook and tried to unite the pirates to attack China. The pirate war against China did not go well for the Dutch, who failed to unite the pirates under their leadership. Nonetheless, they did eventually reach a modus vivendi with Chinese officials and began trading regularly with China. Yet after the collapse of the Ming Empire in 1644, the Dutch increasingly suffered competition from an ex-pirate organization: the powerful Zheng family. Its leader, Zheng Chenggong, created a loyalist state with maritime pretensions. So long as the company was competing against private Chinese seamen who lacked state support, it was able to hold its own. But once these seamen were united in the framework of a maritime Chinese state, the company could not prevail.]","author":[{"family":"Andrade","given":"Tonio"}],"citation-key":"andrade_2004_company","container-title":"Journal of World History","ISSN":"10456007, 15278050","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"415-444","publisher":"University of Hawai'i Press","title":"The company's Chinese pirates: how the Dutch East India Company tried to lead a coalition of pirates to war against China, 1621-1662","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20079290","volume":"15"},

Instead, genocide, slavery and colonialism are the key foundation stones upon which the West was built, and we are still living under this system today: America is now at the helm, perpetuating global inequality through business, government, and institutions like the UN, the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO. The West is rich because the Rest is poor. Capitalism is racism. The West congratulations itself on raising poverty by increments in the developing world while ignoring the fact that it created these conditions in the first place, and continues to perpetuate them. The Enlightenment, which underlies every part of our foundational philosophy today, was and is profoundly racist. This colonial logic was and is used to justify the ransacking of Black and brown bodies and their land. The fashionable solutions offered by the white Left in recent years fall far short of even beginning to tackle the West's place at the helm of a racist global order. Offering no easy answers, The New Age of Empire is essential reading to understand our profoundly corrupt global system. A work of essential clarity, The New Age of Empire is a groundbreaking new blueprint for taking Black Radical thought into the twenty-first century and beyond. --","author":[{"family":"Andrews","given":"Kehinde"}],"citation-key":"andrews_2021_new","event-place":"Dublin","ISBN":"978-0-241-43744-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"251","publisher":"Allen Lane","publisher-place":"Dublin","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The new age of empire: How racism and colonialism still rule the world","title-short":"The new age of empire","type":"book"},

  {"id":"bacon_2023_upper","abstract":"In at least 400 European caves such as Lascaux, Chauvet and Altamira, Upper Palaeolithic\n              Homo sapiens\n              groups drew, painted and engraved non-figurative signs from at least ~42,000\n              bp\n              and figurative images (notably animals) from at least 37,000\n              bp\n              . Since their discovery ~150 years ago, the purpose or meaning of European Upper Palaeolithic non-figurative signs has eluded researchers. Despite this, specialists assume that they were notational in some way. Using a database of images spanning the European Upper Palaeolithic, we suggest how three of the most frequently occurring signs—the line\n              \n                <\n                |\n                >\n              \n              , the dot <•>, and the <Y>—functioned as units of communication. We demonstrate that when found in close association with images of animals the line <\n              |\n              > and dot <•> constitute numbers denoting months, and form constituent parts of a local phenological/meteorological calendar beginning in spring and recording time from this point in lunar months. We also demonstrate that the <Y> sign, one of the most frequently occurring signs in Palaeolithic non-figurative art, has the meaning <To Give Birth>. The\n              position\n              of the <Y> within a sequence of marks denotes month of parturition, an ordinal representation of number in contrast to the cardinal representation used in tallies. Our data indicate that the purpose of this system of associating animals with calendar information was to record and convey seasonal behavioural information about specific prey taxa in the geographical regions of concern. We suggest a specific way in which the pairing of numbers with animal subjects constituted a complete unit of meaning—a notational system combined with its subject—that provides us with a specific insight into what one set of notational marks means. It gives us our first specific reading of European Upper Palaeolithic communication, the first known writing in the history of\n              Homo sapiens\n              .","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Bacon","given":"Bennett"},{"family":"Khatiri","given":"Azadeh"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"James"},{"family":"Freeth","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Pettitt","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Kentridge","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"bacon_2023_upper","container-title":"Cambridge Archaeological Journal","container-title-short":"CAJ","DOI":"10.1017/S0959774322000415","ISSN":"0959-7743, 1474-0540","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8]]},"language":"en","page":"371-389","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Upper Palaeolithic Proto-writing System and Phenological Calendar","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0959774322000415/type/journal_article","volume":"33"},

Recently, an increasing body of research in perception language and in Food Studies has been sparkling new interest and new perspectives on the importance of this sense. Merging anthropology, evolutionary physiology and philosophy, this book investigates the language of Taste in English, and its relationship with our embodied minds. In the first part of the book, the author explores the semantic dimensions of Taste terms with a usage-based approach. With the application of experimental protocols, Bagli enquires their possible organization in a radial network and calculates the Salience index of gustatory terms in both American and British English. The second part of the book is an overview of the metaphorical extensions that motivate the polysemy of Taste terms, with the aid of corpus analysis methods and various texts. This book is the first to review systematically and in a usage-based perspective the role of the sensory domain of Taste in English, showing a more complicated picture and suggesting that its under-representation and difficulty of encoding does not correspond to lack of importance.","author":[{"family":"Bagli","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"bagli_2021_tastes","event-place":"Berlin","ISBN":"978-3-11-062677-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"De Gruyter Mouton","publisher-place":"Berlin","title":"Tastes we live by: The linguistic conceptualisation of taste in English","type":"book"},

For instance, a static framework would view creole situations as \"freak\" situations and creoles as necessarily unstable and rapidly changing. A dynamic framework would endorse the Saussurian paradox that competence is looked for exclusively in the individual, but variety is sought in society. A dynamic framework would hold that competence is polylectal what language-users know about communicating with others more nearly represents their language competence than the subset of this knowledge exhibited in production. The bulk of the text centers around the enumeration of principles and the presentation of models for variation theory. A paper on feature marking and weighting is appended.

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution.

A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Barabási","given":"Albert-László"},{"family":"Albert","given":"Réka"}],"citation-key":"barabasi_1999_emergence","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.286.5439.509","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"5439","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",10,15]]},"language":"en","page":"509-512","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Emergence of Scaling in Random Networks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.286.5439.509","volume":"286"},

Too often, accomplishment does not equal success. We did the work but didn't get the promotion; we played hard but weren't recognized; we had the idea but didn't get the credit. We convince ourselves that talent combined with a strong work ethic is the key to getting ahead, but also realize that combination often fails to yield results, without any deeper understanding as to why. Recognizing this striking disconnect, the author, along with a team of renowned researchers and some of the most advanced data-crunching systems on the planet, dedicated themselves to one goal: uncovering that ever-elusive link between performance and success.

Thus when one taste nerve is damaged another compensates; however, the cost may be a taste phantom. Work on genetic variation in taste has identified supertasters of PROP (6-n-propylthiouracil) who are unusually sensitive to bitters and sweets as well as the burn from chili pepper (active ingredient capsaicin).

  {"id":"bartoshuk_2012_taste","abstract":"Otitis media and tonsillectomy are associated with enhanced palatability of energy dense foods and with weight gain. Otitis media can damage the chorda tympani nerve (CN VII); tonsillectomy and head and neck radiation treatment can damage the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). Both of these nerves function prominently in taste sensation. The present study utilizes these sources of damage to study central interactions among the nerves that mediate oral sensations. Mild damage restricted to one of these nerves can actually intensify sensations evoked from undamaged nerves (i.e., whole‐mouth taste, oral tactile sensations evoked by fats and irritants). These intensifications may result from disruption of central inhibitory taste circuits, as taste damage appears to disinhibit other oral sensory nerves. In addition, mild damage restricted to one taste nerve can intensify odors perceived from foods in the mouth during chewing and swallowing (i.e., retronasal olfaction); this may be a secondary consequence of the intensification of whole-mouth taste. Damage to both nerves leads to widespread oral sensory loss. At present, the link between sensory alterations and weight gain has not been established for adults (e.g., does increased fat preference occur in individuals with oral sensory intensifications, those with losses, or both?). Finally, pain in non-oral locations is also related to taste loss. When participants rated “the most intense pain of any kind they had ever experienced,” those with the greatest taste loss gave the highest ratings. These effects suggest that taste loss significantly influences long-term health outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."},{"family":"Catalanotto","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Hoffman","given":"Howard"},{"family":"Logan","given":"Henrietta"},{"family":"Snyder","given":"Derek J."}],"citation-key":"bartoshuk_2012_taste","container-title":"Physiology & Behavior","DOI":"10.1016/j.physbeh.2012.06.013","ISSN":"0031-9384","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"516-526","title":"Taste Damage (Otitis Media, Tonsillectomy and Head and Neck Cancer), Oral Sensations and BMI","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938412002375","volume":"107"},

The articles on conceptions deal with issues of space and time as treated in the field of world history as well as questions of method, epistemology, the historiography of the area, and globalization as viewed from historical perspective. Themes present in the book include the natural environment, agriculture, pastoral nomadism, science, technology, state formation, gender, and religion. Articles dealing with large-scale processes review current thinking on some of the most influential developments of the global past, including mass migrations, cross-cultural trade, biological diffusions, imperial expansion, industrialization, and cultural and religious exchanges.

  {"id":"bentley_2019_picturing","abstract":"Combining strikingly new scholarship by art historians, historians, and ethnomusicologists, this interdisciplinary volume illuminates trade ties within East Asia, and from East Asia outwards, in the years 1550 to 1800. While not encyclopedic, the selected topics greatly advance our sense of this trade picture. Throughout the book, multi-part trade structures are excavated; the presence of European powers within the Asian trade nexus features as part of this narrative. Visual goods are highlighted, including lacquerwares, musical instruments, Chinese bronze coins, unfired ceramic portrait figurines, and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Southeast Asian ceramic vessels. These essays underscore the significance of Asian industries producing multiples, and the rhetorical charge of these goods, shifting in meaning as they move. Building reverberations between merchant networks and the look of the objects themselves, this richly-illustrated book brings to light the Asian trade engine powering the early modern visual cultures of East and Southeast Asia, the American colonies, and Europe.","citation-key":"bentley_2019_picturing","collection-title":"Visual and Material Culture, 1300-1700","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctvcwn6kn","editor":[{"family":"Bentley","given":"Tamara H."}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-94-6298-467-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","title":"Picturing commerce in and from the East Asian maritime circuits, 1550-1800","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvcwn6kn"},

This volume, published in 1857, contains Girolamo Benzoni's History of the New World, originally published in Venice in 1565. The book is not only a history of the New World since Columbus' discovery but an account of what Benzoni himself saw, when 'being like many others anxious to see the world, and hearing of those countries of the Indians, recently found, called by everybody the New World, I determined to go there'.

  {"id":"bian_2020_know","abstract":"\"Traditional Chinese medicine has been practiced in various forms for more than a thousand years. Practitioners may heal patients with herbal remedies, acupuncture, massage, exercise, and modified diets. Even today, herbal medicines are of particular importance; Chinese pharmacies containing a vast array of remedies can be found in cities and towns the world over. This book is an interdisciplinary and cultural history of the concept of \"pharmacy,\" both the drugs themselves and the trade in medicine, during the Ming and Qing dynasties of early modern China. This was a time of change for traditional Chinese medicine and for Chinese science as a whole. Many historians have argued that sixteenth-century China was a high point of scientific inquiry, followed by a period of intellectual decline. Though political and intellectual shifts led to a crisis of authority over pharmaceutical knowledge in the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries, Bian argues that this period of supposed intellectual decline was in fact characterized by numerous efforts to further refine and spread the pharmacological knowledge amassed in the Ming dynasty. She draws on a wide range of primary sources, but particularly through the study of bencao (pronounced \"pen ts'ao\"), a genre of encyclopaedic works, often called matteria medica or pharmacopoeia in the West, that collect information on medicinal substances.

In Eating the Empire, Troy Bickham unfolds the extraordinary role that food played in shaping Britain during the `long' eighteenth century (c. 1660-1837), when coffee, tea, and sugar went from rare luxuries to some of the most ubiquitous commodities in Britain, reaching even the poorest and remotest of households. Bickham reveals how the trade in the empire's edibles underpinned the emerging consumer economy, fomenting the rise of modern retailing, visual advertising and consumer credit, and, via taxes, financed the military and civil bureaucracy that secured, governed and spread the empire.","author":[{"family":"Bickham","given":"Troy O."}],"citation-key":"bickham_2020_eating","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78914-207-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"Reaktion Books","publisher-place":"London","title":"Eating the empire: Food and society in eighteenth-century Britain","type":"book"},

On the strength of the new data which has emerged in the last two decades in the form of archaeological findings, as well as new techniques such as GIS modeling, the authors collectively demonstrate the existence of a very early global maritime trade. From architecture to cuisine, and language to clothing, evidence points to early connections both within Asia and between Asia and other continents—well before European explorations of the Global South. The human stories presented here offer insights into both the extent and limits of this global exchange, showing how goods and people traveled vast distances, how they were embedded in regional networks, and how local cultures were shaped as a result.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,22]]},"citation-key":"bille_2022_maritime","DOI":"10.5117/9789463722247","editor":[{"family":"Billé","given":"Franck"},{"family":"Mehendale","given":"Sanjyot"},{"family":"Lankton","given":"James W."}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-90-485-5242-9 978-94-6372-224-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The maritime silk road: Global connectivities, regional nodes, localities","title-short":"The maritime silk road","type":"book","URL":"https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789463722247"},
  {"id":"billing_1998_antimicrobial","abstract":"Although spices have been important for centuries in food preparation throughout the world, patterns of spice use differ considerably among cultures and countries. What factors underlie these differences? Why are spices used at all? to investigate these questions, we quantified the frequency of use of 43 spices in the meat-based cuisines of the 36 countries for which we could locate traditional cookbooks. A total 4578 recipes from 93 cookbooks was analysed. We also compiled information on the temperature and precipitation in each country, the ranges of spice plants, and the antibacterial properties of each spice. These data were used to investigate the hypothesis that spices inhibit or kill food-spoilage microorganisms. In support of this is the fact that spice plant secondary compounds are powerful antimicrobial (i.e., antibacterial and antifungal) agents. As mean annual temperatures (an indicator of relative spoilage rates of unrefrigerated foods) increased, the proportion of recipes containing spices, number of spices per recipe, total number of spices used, and use of the most potent antibacterial spices all increased, both within and among countries. Likewise, the estimated fraction of bacterial species inhibited per recipe in each country was positively correlated with annual temperature. Several alternative hypotheses were considered-that spices provide macronutrients, disguise the taste and smell of spoiled foods, or increase perspiration and thus evaporative cooling; it also is conceivable that spice use provides no benefits. However, none of these four alternatives was well supported by our data. The proximate reason spices are used obviously is to enhance food palatability. But the ultimate reason is most likely that spices help cleanse foods of pathogens and thereby contribute to the health, longevity and reproductive success of people who find their flavors enjoyable.","author":[{"family":"Billing","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"Sherman","given":"Paul W."}],"citation-key":"billing_1998_antimicrobial","container-title":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","container-title-short":"The Quarterly Review of Biology","DOI":"10.1086/420058","ISSN":"00335770, 15397718","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","page":"3-49","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Antimicrobial Functions of Spices: Why Some Like it Hot","title-short":"Antimicrobial Functions of Spices","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3036683","volume":"73"},

Along the Silk Roads in Mongol Eurasia reveals the individual stories of three key groups-military commanders, merchants, and intellectuals-from across Eurasia. These annotated biographies bring to the fore a compelling picture of the Mongol Empire pulled from a wide range of historical sources in multiple languages, providing important insights into a period unique for its rapid and far-reaching transformations. Read together or separately, they offer the perfect starting point for any discussion of the Mongol Empire's impact on China, the Muslim world, and the West, as well as for illustrating the scale, diversity, and creativity of the cross-cultural exchange along the continental and maritime Silk Roads. Features and Benefits: Synthesizes historical information from Chinese, Arabic, Persian, and Latin sources that are otherwise inaccessible to English-speaking audiences. Presents in an accessible manner individual life stories that serve as a spring board for discussing themes such as military expansion, cross cultural contacts, migration, conversion, gender, diplomacy, trans-regional commercial networks and more.

  {"id":"blench__fruits","abstract":"One unconscious bias that commonly creeps into accounts ofthe development and spread ofagriculture is an emphasis on cereals and tubers. Since these are the basis of agriculture in the developed world, when students of prehistory construct narratives in the tropics they tend to focus on these classes of cultigen and to downplay both trees and herbs. The classicfeature for distinguishing crops from their wildforbears in such narratives is morphological change, a criterion which may apply only weakly or not at all to trees and herbs. The domestication oftree products must be identified principally on distributional grounds as they are used and discardedfar from their 'home' area. Although prehistory in the Inda-Pacific region has begun to emphasise the importance of arboriculture in overall subsistence, it has been hamstrung by weak synchronic accounts ofthe taxonomy, origin and spread of the major and minorfruit trees. Recent ethnographic work has begun to remedy this situation, but has yet to be absorbed into archaeological models. Biogeography can therefore be of considerable importance in determining the evolution of arboricultural subsistence, especially in a region with so many islands, where settlement can be associated with the introduction ofnew species.","author":[{"family":"Blench","given":"Roger"}],"citation-key":"blench__fruits","container-title":"Indo-Pacific prehistory association bulletin","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Fruits and arboriculture in the Indo-Pacific region","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

(Food globalization in prehistory, World Archaeology , 2011, 43(4), 665-75) explores a prehistoric 'Trans-Eurasian' episode of food globalization characterized by the long-distance exchange of starch crops. Drawing upon a comparison to the Columbian Exchange, they emphasize the role of fast-growing crops in optimizing productivity, giving minimal consideration to other drivers. Here we re-evaluate the sequence and timing of the Trans-Eurasian exchange and give greater consideration to the social dimensions of plant translocation. We outline a model for thinking about plant translocations that highlights the way the conceptualization and use of introduced plants changes through time, with social factors frequently dominating in the early stages.","author":[{"family":"Boivin","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Dorian Q"},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Alison"}],"citation-key":"boivin_2012_old","container-title":"World Archaeology","container-title-short":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2012.729404","ISSN":"0043-8243","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"452-469","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Old World globalization and the Columbian exchange: comparison and contrast","title-short":"Old World globalization and the Columbian exchange","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00438243.2012.729404","volume":"44"},

  {"id":"borschberg_2020_when","abstract":"A century ago, research on the Malay world was experiencing major breakthroughs on several fronts, but the greatest achievement at the time was without doubt George Coedès’ ‘rediscovery’, based on Asian sources, of a forgotten kingdom named Srivijaya. His book, published in 1918, saw a wave of publications follow in its wake. Sources were trawled in the hope of finding answers to unresolved issues and unidentified place names. Attention invariably also fell on Melaka. In a long article published by the French academic and diplomat Gabriel Ferrand in the same year, the question of Melaka's founding date came under the spotlight. What do the different surviving sources tell us? What about Gaspar Correia's claim that Melaka was a thriving port city for centuries before the arrival of the Portuguese? Was the city — just as in the case of Temasek (Singapore) — known by a different name in earlier times? Ferrand's publication provoked a response from the Dutch academic Gerret Pieter Rouffaer, director of the KITLV. What he planned to be a 20-odd page response to Ferrand swelled into a multifaceted argument running into hundreds of pages. The debate between Ferrand and Rouffaer that touched on Melaka and Temasek-Singapura's early history probably eluded most of their academic contemporaries who were not proficient in both Dutch and French, especially in the English-speaking world. The present article reconstructs the main points of this debate together with their echo in historiography. It makes a contribution to the ongoing discourses, especially in Malaysia, concerning the founding date of Melaka.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Borschberg","given":"Peter"}],"citation-key":"borschberg_2020_when","container-title":"Journal of Southeast Asian Studies","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"breslin_1993_psychophysical","abstract":"Aluminum potassium sulphate [AIK(SO4)2 12H2O—‘alum’] was tested for its ability to elicit oral astringency independently of its ability to elicit taste. First, the astringency produced by alum (10 g/l; 21.1 mM) on the non-gustatory surfaces between the gum and the upper lip was measured. Subjects reported that alum elicited sensations of astringency when the upper lip was moved laterally against the gum. Second, subjects dipped the tongue into two solutions—alum or a mixture solution that approximated the taste of alum—and attempted to determine which solution was more astringent. A slight tendency was found for subjects to identify the mixture as more astringent than the alum. However, the same subjects reported the alum to be more astringent than the mixture when the same solutions were applied under the upper lip. These two experiments support the hypothesis that tactile stimulation is important for producing astringency, whereas taste stimulation of the anterior tongue is not. Third, after the application of alum, lubricating rinses (water, sucrose, Salivart®, corn oil, and the subjects' own saliva) were compared for their ability to decrease astringency. The lubricants reliably decreased original astringency, but to varying degrees depending upon their lubricating properties. All three experiments suggest that tactile sensations caused by increased friction (decreases,in salivary lubrication) between oral membranes are the primary basis of astringent sensations.","author":[{"family":"Breslin","given":"P.

  {"id":"butt_2013_black","abstract":"For millennia, spices have been an integral part of human diets and commerce. Recently, the widespread recognition of diethealth linkages bolsters their dietary importance. The bioactive components present in them are of considerable signiﬁcance owing to their therapeutic potential against various ailments. They provide physiological beneﬁts or prevent chronic ailment in addition to the fundamental nutrition and often included in the category of functional foods. Black pepper (Piper Nigrum L.) is an important healthy food owing to its antioxidant, antimicrobial potential and gastro-protective modules. Black pepper, with piperine as an active ingredient, holds rich phytochemistry that also includes volatile oil, oleoresins, and alkaloids. More recently, cell-culture studies and animal modeling predicted the role of black pepper against number of maladies. The free-radical scavenging activity of black pepper and its active ingredients might be helpful in chemoprevention and controlling progression of tumor growth. Additionally, the key alkaloid components of Piper Nigrum, that is, piperine assist in cognitive brain functioning, boost nutrient’s absorption and improve gastrointestinal functionality. In this comprehensive treatise, efforts are made to elucidate the antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inﬂammatory, gastro-protective, and antidepressant activities of black pepper. Moreover, the synergistic interaction of black pepper with different drugs and nutrients is the limelight of the manuscript. However, the aforementioned health-promoting beneﬁts associated with black pepper are proven in animal modeling. Thus, there is a need to conduct controlled randomized trials in human subjects, cohort studies, and meta-analyses. Such future studies would be helpful in recommending its application in diet-based regimens to prevent various ailments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Butt","given":"Masood Sadiq"},{"family":"Pasha","given":"Imran"},{"family":"Sultan","given":"Muhammad Tauseef"},{"family":"Randhawa","given":"Muhammad Atif"},{"family":"Saeed","given":"Farhan"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Waqas"}],"citation-key":"butt_2013_black","container-title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","container-title-short":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/10408398.2011.571799","ISSN":"1040-8398, 1549-7852","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",1]]},"language":"en","page":"875-886","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Black Pepper and Health Claims: A Comprehensive Treatise","title-short":"Black Pepper and Health Claims","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408398.2011.571799","volume":"53"},

  {"id":"caboara_2022_regnum","abstract":"\"The first European map of China faintly relied on the copy of a Chinese original, obtained through bribing and espionage; the last covered in this book was the result of the largest land survey ever made until that time. These two and another 125 maps depict, sometimes uniquely, sometimes copying each other, a country whose images were so different that it was hard to understand which to trust. This study reproduces and describes, for the first time, all the maps of China printed in Europe between 1584 and 1735, unravelling the origin of each individual map, their different printing, issues and publication dates. It also tells, for each, the unique story that made possible these visions from another world, stories marked by scholarly breakthroughs, obsession, missionary zeal, commercial sagacity and greed. China on Copper Plates: The First 150 Years of Chinese Maps in Western Prints (1584-1735) For a presentation from the author related to the publication, see: https://repository.hkust.edu.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-117848 . A summary: On June 23, 2022, the fourth session of the academic lecture series on \"The Weavers of Four-Dimensional Space-Time and Their Creation\" on the History of Maps was held in the form of an online seminar at the Kuang-Chi International Scholars Center. Dr. Marco Caboara, an Italian scholar from the Lee Shau Kee Library of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, gave a lively presentation entitled \"China on Copperplate - the First 150 Years of Western Printed Maps of China, 1584-1735\". The lecture was conducted in both Chinese and English. Associate Professor Lin Hong from the School of Humanities of Shanghai Normal University served as the moderator and translator. Dr. Yang Xunling, Deputy Director of the Library of Macau University of Science and Technology, served as the main responder. Professor Huang Yijun of Minzu University of China, and Deputy Youth Associate of Fudan University Researcher Ding Yannan, Dr. Catarina Batista and Dr. Ângela Gil from the Library of Macau University of Science and Technology, and Dr. Zheng Man from the Free University of Berlin participated in the discussion.

However, despite the growing interest in the Chinese language, there are only a few sources of word frequency measures available to researchers, and the quality is less than what researchers in other languages are used to.\nMethodology: Following recent work by New, Brysbaert, and colleagues in English, French and Dutch, we assembled a database of word and character frequencies based on a corpus of film and television subtitles (46.8 million characters, 33.5 million words). In line with what has been found in the other languages, the new word and character frequencies explain significantly more of the variance in Chinese word naming and lexical decision performance than measures based on written texts.\nConclusions: Our results confirm that word frequencies based on subtitles are a good estimate of daily language exposure and capture much of the variance in word processing efficiency. In addition, our database is the first to include information about the contextual diversity of the words and to provide good frequency estimates for multi-character words and the different syntactic roles in which the words are used. The word frequencies are freely available for research purposes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Brysbaert","given":"Marc"}],"citation-key":"cai_2010_subtlexch","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0010729","editor":[{"family":"Rodriguez-Fornells","given":"Antoni"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",6,2]]},"language":"en","page":"e10729","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"SUBTLEX-CH: Chinese Word and Character Frequencies Based on Film Subtitles","title-short":"SUBTLEX-CH","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010729","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"caicedo_2001_taste","abstract":"Recent studies showing that single taste bud cells express multiple bitter taste receptors have reignited a long-standing controversy over whether single gustatory receptor cells respond selectively or broadly to tastants. We examined calcium responses of rat taste receptor cells in situ to a panel of bitter compounds to determine whether individual cells distinguish between bitter stimuli. Most bitter-responsive taste cells were activated by only one out of five compounds tested. In taste cells that responded to multiple stimuli, there were no significant associations between any two stimuli. Bitter sensation does not appear to occur through the activation of a homogeneous population of broadly tuned bitter-sensitive taste cells. Instead, different bitter stimuli may activate different subpopulations of bitter-sensitive taste cells.","author":[{"family":"Caicedo","given":"A."},{"family":"Roper","given":"S.

As is commonly the case for copies of this text, the London Qazvīnī is lavishly illustrated, with 368 extant paintings out of the estimated original ca. 520. Its large format, ambitious illustrative cycle and the fine quality of many of the illustrations suggest that the atelier where it was produced must have been well-established and able to attract craftsmen from different parts of the Ilkhanid area. It also suggests that its patron was wealthy and curious about scientific, encyclopedic and 'ajā'ib literature, and keen to experiment with the illustration of new texts like this work, which had been composed by the author only two or three decades earlier. The only centre that was capable of gathering such artistic influences ranging from Anatolia to Mesopotamia appears to have been Mosul. The London Qazvīnī is an important newly surfaced document for the study of early illustrated Arabic copies of this text, representing the second earliest known surviving manuscript, as well as for the study of Ilkhanid painting. In a single and unique manuscript are gathered earlier Mesopotamian painting traditions, North Jaziran-Seljuq elements, Anatolian inspirations, the latest changes brought about after the advent of the Mongols, and a number of illustrations of extraordinary subjects which escape a proper classification.\" -- Publisher's website\n\nOutgrowth of the author's thesis (doctoral--University of London, 1992) under the title: Wonders of creation and the singularities of Ilkhanid painting","author":[{"family":"Carboni","given":"Stefano"}],"call-number":"ND3399.Q23 C37 2015","citation-key":"carboni_2015_wonders","collection-title":"Edinburgh studies in Islamic art","event-place":"Edinburgh","ISBN":"978-0-7486-8324-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn919015993","number-of-pages":"428","publisher":"Edinburgh University Press","publisher-place":"Edinburgh","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The wonders of creation and the singularities of painting: A study of the Ilkhanid London Qazvīnī","title-short":"The wonders of creation and the singularities of painting","type":"book"},

It is largely cultivated in Iran, India, Afghanistan, Greece, Morocco, Spain and Italy. Saﬀron global production is estimated at 418 t y−1 on 121,338 ha. It is known as the most expensive spice in the world and as beneﬁcial for human health due to three main bioactive compounds: crocin, picrocrocin and safranal. The demand for saﬀron is increasing worldwide for its interesting role in cuisine, medicine and cosmetics. Due to the reduction of its production, recent investigations have been conducted to study how to improve stigma yield, quality and antioxidant activity by selecting of corm geographical origin and climatic conditions, using biostimulants such as mycorrhizal fungi as well as choosing irrigation regimes, drying methods and storage processes. New research activities have been focused on the medicinal properties of this spice, such as its neuroprotection in the context of ocular disease, free radical scavenging and detoxifying capacities.

  {"id":"carling_2019_causality","abstract":"All languages borrow words from other languages. Some languages are more prone to borrowing, while others borrow less, and different domains of the vocabulary are unequally susceptible to borrowing. Languages typically borrow words when a new concept is introduced, but languages may also borrow a new word for an already existing concept. Linguists describe two causalities for borrowing: need, i.e., the internal pressure of borrowing a new term for a concept in the language, and prestige, i.e., the external pressure of borrowing a term from a more prestigious language. We investigate lexical loans in a dataset of 104 concepts in 115 Eurasian languages from 7 families occupying a coherent contact area of the Eurasian landmass, of which Indo-European languages from various periods constitute a majority. We use a cognacy-coded dataset, which identifies loan events including a source and a target language. To avoid loans for newly introduced concepts in languages, we use a list of lexical concepts that have been in use at least since the Chalcolithic (4000–3000 BCE). We observe that the rates of borrowing are highly variable among concepts, lexical domains, languages, language families, and time periods. We compare our results to those of a global sample and observe that our rates are generally lower, but that the rates between the samples are significantly correlated. To test the causality of borrowing, we use two different ranks. Firstly, to test need, we use a cultural ranking of concepts by their mobility (of nature items) or their labour intensity and “distance-from-hearth” (of culture items). Secondly, to test prestige, we use a power ranking of languages by their socio-cultural status. We conclude that the borrowability of concepts increases with increasing mobility (nature), and with increased labour intensity and “distance-from-hearth” (culture). We also conclude that language prestige is not correlated with borrowability in general (all languages borrow, independently of prestige), but prestige predicts the directionality of borrowing, from a more prestigious language to a less prestigious one. The process is not constant over time, with a larger inequality during the ancient and modern periods, but this result may depend on the status of the data (non-prestigious languages often remain unattested). In conclusion, we observe that need and prestige compete as causes of lexical borrowing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Carling","given":"Gerd"},{"family":"Cronhamn","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Farren","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Aliyev","given":"Elnur"},{"family":"Frid","given":"Johan"}],"citation-key":"carling_2019_causality","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0223588","editor":[{"family":"Wichmann","given":"Søren"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,30]]},"language":"en","page":"e0223588","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The causality of borrowing: Lexical loans in Eurasian languages","title-short":"The causality of borrowing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223588","volume":"14"},

And yet, while modern scholars have been aware of this sea change in global commerce for generations, the reasons behind it still remain a subject of debate. Numerous explanations have been proposed, ranging from changes in the international demand for spices to corruption within the Portuguese administration. Until now, however, none has taken into account what may be the most important factor of all: the rising power of Ottoman corsairs, whose predatory raids against Portuguese targets were instrumental in subverting the\n              Estado da India's\n              system for controlling trade in the western Indian Ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Casale","given":"Giancarlo"}],"citation-key":"casale_2008_ottoman","container-title":"Itinerario","container-title-short":"Itinerario","DOI":"10.1017/S0165115300001704","ISSN":"0165-1153, 2041-2827","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",3]]},"language":"en","page":"59-79","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Ottoman <i>Guerre de Course</i> and the Indian Ocean Spice Trade: The Career of Sefer Reis","title-short":"Ottoman <i>Guerre de Course</i> and the Indian Ocean Spice Trade","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0165115300001704/type/journal_article","volume":"32"},

  {"id":"chen_1975_sound","abstract":"[In the present paper we address ourselves to two fundamental questions regarding sound change: (1) HOW does a sound change implement itself? and (2) WHY does a phonological process assume a particular form, and follow a particular pattern or schedule? In answer to the question of implementation, we propose the concept of LEXICAL DIFFUSION. We have amassed a sizable amount of evidence drawn from the history of Chinese, English, and Swedish, as well as from language acquisition, to substantiate the claim that a phonological change propagates itself gradually across the lexicon, from morpheme to morpheme. In partial answer to the second question, concerning the actuation of phonological processes, we propose that the principal determinants of sound change are to be sought in the inherent constraints of the physiological and perceptual apparatus of the language user. To illustrate the point, we have investigated the attrition of the consonantal endings in a large number of Chinese dialects, and have found significant parallels in the development of well-known Indo-European languages. We argue that the cross-linguistically prevalent pattern and schedule of the related processes are traceable to their PHONETIC ACTUATION. Experimental evidence, both perceptual and physiological, is produced in support.]","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Matthew Y."},{"family":"Wang","given":"William S.

  {"id":"chen_2014_study","abstract":"Summary Since Japanese language makes extensive use of Chinese characters in its writing system, and a large portion of its vocabulary is borrowed from Chinese in ancient times, it makes people to believe that Chinese always has the overwhelming influence on Japanese. However, the situation is completely changed since modern times. A great number of Japanese words entered into Chinese. Nevertheless, many Chinese people still think that nowadays Chinese language is in a dominant position in linguistic exchange between Chinese and Japanese. The goal of this research is to give people better understanding of the significance of Japanese loanwords in modern Chinese. In this paper, I analyze the channels, classifications, characteristics and influences of Japanese loanwords in different time backgrounds. The findings are mainly based on about one thousand Japanese loanwords that I collected from dictionaries and academic papers. The main results are that Japanese loanwords take an important part in creating new words and formating modern Chinese. Research also indicates that both linguistic factor and social factor affect loanwords, meanwhile, the host language and society are influenced by loanwords. Therefore both Chinese language and society affect the intakes of Japanese loanwords, at the same time the Chinese language and society are also influenced by Japanese loanwords.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Haijing"}],"citation-key":"chen_2014_study","event-place":"Oslo","genre":"M.A.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher":"University of Oslo","publisher-place":"Oslo","title":"A study of Japanese loanwords in Chinese","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"chen_2019_global","abstract":"Using newly developed concepts of network theory, this paper tries to advance the theoretical analysis of Zheng He’s seven epic voyages across the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1433, and to resolve some long-debated key issues on the subject. It also attempts to reveal how Zheng He helped change Sino-foreign relations in the early fifteenth ­century by developing tribute-trade networks overseas, and thereby i­ nfluenced the history of China, the Indian Ocean region, and globalization in general. An e­ xamination of the primary sources from the network perspective indicates that the development of tribute-trade relations overseas made up the primary purpose, major ­activities and enduring historical legacies of Zheng He’s voyages. Zheng He initiated the construction of overseas bases for navigation and trade, and thus greatly promoted the institutionalization and expansion of tribute-trade relations between China and the Indian Ocean world. Both the tribute and trade networks contracted ­after Zheng He’s voyages ended because of their failure to diversify beyond state-m­ onopolized diplomacy and trade. But their development in the early fifteenth century and their continuity thereafter brought China and Indian Ocean countries into unprecedented interactions. The dual networks also provided a foundation for the European “geographic discoveries” in the Indian Ocean later on, for the early contact between China and the West and ultimately for the globalization of the modern world. ­Therefore, a network analysis of Zheng He’s voyages and the subsequent tribute-trade relations between China and the Indian Ocean world can refine the current theoretical paradigms and narrative frameworks of world history, which are still centered on the rise and expansion of modern Europe and the West. It also reveals how such non-Western historical movements and premodern tribute-trade relations exerted influence on a global network revolution, which linked the old and new worlds through an unprecedented level of relational institutionalization, expansion, diversification and interactions between varied network members in global history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhongping"}],"citation-key":"chen_2019_global","container-title":"China and Asia","container-title-short":"China Asia","DOI":"10.1163/2589465X-00101002","ISSN":"2589-4641, 2589-465X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"3-49","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Toward a Global Network Revolution: Zheng He’s Maritime Voyages and Tribute-Trade Relations between China and the Indian Ocean World","title-short":"Toward a Global Network Revolution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/cahs/1/1/article-p3_3.xml","volume":"1"},
  {"id":"chen_2019_mandarin","abstract":"Modality exclusivity norms have been developed in different languages for research on the relationship between perceptual and conceptual systems. This paper sets up the first modality exclusivity norms for Chinese, a Sino-Tibetan language with semantics as its orthographically relevant level. The norms are collected through two studies based on Chinese sensory words. The experimental designs take into consideration the morpho-lexical and orthographic structures of Chinese. Study 1 provides a set of norms for Mandarin Chinese single-morpheme words in mean ratings of the extent to which a word is experienced through the five sense modalities. The degrees of modality exclusivity are also provided. The collected norms are further analyzed to examine how sub-lexical orthographic representations of sense modalities in Chinese characters affect speakers’ interpretation of the sensory words. In particular, we found higher modality exclusivity rating for the sense modality explicitly represented by a semantic radical component, as well as higher auditory dominant modality rating for characters with transparent phonetic symbol components. Study 2 presents the mean ratings and modality exclusivity of coordinate disyllabic compounds involving multiple sense modalities. These studies open new perspectives in the study of modality exclusivity. First, links between modality exclusivity and writing systems have been established which has strengthened previous accounts of the influence of orthography in the processing of visual information in reading. Second, a new set of modality exclusivity norms of compounds is proposed to show the competition of influence on modality exclusivity from different linguistic factors and potentially allow such norms to be linked to studies on synesthesia and semantic transparency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"I-Hsuan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingqing"},{"family":"Long","given":"Yunfei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"chen_2019_mandarin","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0211336","editor":[{"family":"Cai","given":"Zhiqiang"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e0211336","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Mandarin Chinese modality exclusivity norms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211336","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"chen_2019_metaphor","abstract":"Metaphors are compact packages of information with rich cultural background information. As one of the most powerful linguistic forms with non-literal meaning, metaphor detection in natural language processing can be both challenging and rewarding. We propose an innovative method for metaphor detection and classiﬁcation leveraging culturally grounded eventive information. This culturally grounded information is organized based on ontological structure, which in turn facilitates further semantic processing of the result of our classiﬁcation. As a culturally bound ontological system, the Chinese writing system has basic concepts organized according to semantic radicals, which are symbols containing rich eventive information that represent categorical concepts. This paper illustrates the basic design principles of applying ontological structures in metaphor detection by taking into account radicals representing body parts, instruments, materials, and movements. Our approach to leverage the eventive information of the Chinese writing system in metaphor detection is based on the fact that such information is available as an integral part of the writing system of any text. We hypothesize that eventive information can be accessed through the ‘‘embodied’’ source domain information represented by the radicals without syntactic processing or annotation. In terms of the theory of metaphor, we further hypothesize that eventive types in the embodied source domain maps to, and hence can help to predict, eventive meaning in the target domain of metaphor. Our studies show that the event information encoded in lexical items can facilitate classiﬁcation of metaphoric events and identiﬁcation of metaphors in Chinese texts effectively. We achieved improvements in Chinese metaphor detection over state-of-the-art approaches in our ﬁrst classiﬁcation experiment, and our proposed approach is shown to be generalizable in a second experiment involving new sets of characters with the same radicals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"I-Hsuan"},{"family":"Long","given":"Yunfei"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"chen_2019_metaphor","container-title":"IEEE Access","container-title-short":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2892042","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"10987-10998","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metaphor Detection: Leveraging Culturally Grounded Eventive Information","title-short":"Metaphor Detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8610071/","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"chen_2020_systemic","abstract":"Previous studies on loanwords have tended to be langue-based, focusing on lexicographical documentation and on establishing formal criteria for integration of loanwords into the recipient language in terms of experiential meaning. The recent pragmatic turn in loanword studies signals a parole-oriented approach which shifts attention to the use and functions of loanwords in the recipient language beyond denotative meanings alone. However, there has not been a consistent systematic linguistic framework that could characterize loanwords in the recipient language and that could explore the interaction of langue and parole concerning loanwords. This paper intends to fill this gap by proposing a corpus-informed systemic functional linguistic (SFL) model to account for the characterology of loanwords. Based on the proposed multi-stratal model, kowtow, a Chinese loanword into the English language, is examined for its behaviours at the strata of phonology, lexicogrammar, and discourse semantics as well as how it is embedded in context. Attention at these various levels shows that kowtow demonstrates rich lexicogrammatical productivity in the recipient language and displays strikingly different lexicogrammatical patterns from its Chinese counterpart, indicating that its meaning potentials are activated and extended in the cross-cultural contexts. In fact, by crossing cultures, it actually inverts its connotative meaning.","author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Wenge"},{"family":"Irwin","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Xing","given":"Junjun"}],"citation-key":"chen_2020_systemic","container-title":"Lingua","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2020.102977","ISSN":"0024-3841","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"102977","title":"Towards a Systemic Functional Model for Characterizing Chinese Loanwords in English: The Case of Kowtow","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384120301856","volume":"248"},

  {"id":"cheung_2022_impossible","abstract":"\"In a place where time is running out, sometimes the most radical act is remembrance. Hong Kong has long been known as a city of extremes: a former colony of the United Kingdom that today exists at the margins of an authoritarian, ascendant China; a city rocked by mass protests, where residents take to the streets to rally against encroaching threats on their democracy and freedoms. But it is also misunderstood and often romanticized, its history and politics oversimplified in Western headlines. Drawing richly from her own experience, as well as countless interviews with the artists, protestors, students, and writers who have made Hong Kong their home, journalist Karen Cheung gives us an insider's view of this remarkable city, making the case along the way that we should look to Hong Kong as a warning sign for what lies ahead for other global democracies. Coming of age in the wake of Hong Kong's reunification with China in 1997, Cheung traverses the multifold identities available to her in childhood and beyond, whether that was at her English-speaking international schools, where her classmates were often the children of diplomats or corporate officers, or within her deeply traditional family. Along the way, Cheung gives a personal account of what it's like to seek out affordable housing and mental healthcare in one of the world's most expensive cities. She also takes us into Hong Kong's vibrant indie music and literary scenes--youth-driven spaces of creative resistance. Inevitably, Cheung brings us with her to the protests, where her understanding of what it means to belong to Hong Kong finally crystallized\"--","author":[{"family":"Cheung","given":"Karen"}],"call-number":"DS796.H753","citation-key":"cheung_2022_impossible","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-593-24145-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Random House","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The impossible city: A Hong Kong memoir","title-short":"The impossible city","type":"book"},

As for Columbus, born in Genoa on the Italian peninsula in 1451 and given the name Cristobal de Colon, he is a more transformative man than Cortes in bringing Western Civilization to the major Caribbean islands in the Spanish West Indies and beyond. Historians strive to present a usable past and the post-Columbian world is, of course, the modern world. Columbus's discoveries, those of other mariners who followed to the south in America, and still other eastward to the Asia placed the world on the path of global interdependence-both good and ill-for peoples of the world.

The essay accordingly highlights such overlooked themes as the bureaucratic complexities that were involved in long-distance ambassadorial tours, the role ceremonials played in elite intercourse, and the myriad ways in which material culture mediated interstate exchanges. While its significance lies also in how it decentres a dominant scholarly focus on encounters between Europe and its others, scrutiny of this collection, I additionally argue, can enhance historical understanding of how reciprocal relations between Islamicate polities transformed due to growing European influence. As contemporary configurations of imperial power changed in both South Asia and the Middle East, the Mysore-Ottoman embassy hence at once reflected and anticipated the advent of European—and more specifically, British—hegemony in non-European diplomatic contexts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Choudhury","given":"Rishad"}],"citation-key":"choudhury_2023_tipu","container-title":"Itinerario","container-title-short":"Itinerario","DOI":"10.1017/S0165115323000025","ISSN":"0165-1153, 2041-2827","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tipu and the Turks: An Islamicate Embassy in the Age of British Expansion","title-short":"Tipu and the Turks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0165115323000025/type/journal_article"},

The company has had massive commercial success in both international and domestic markets. As a brand Indomie is caught in two distinct flows: the global and the national. The company is reliant on global supply and distribution networks, without which it would be unable to produce its instant noodles. Simultaneously, Indomie occupies a cultural position as part of an Indonesian soft “gastronationalism.” Drawing on Webb Keane’s work on affordances, I explore how the national and international flows afford specific uses to Indomie with special reference to the brand’s public presentation. Using this method of analysis, I show how Indomie draws from an idea of “Indonesianness” and how other actors have read Indomie as an unconventional symbol of Indonesian nationhood.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Clifford","given":"Joe"}],"citation-key":"clifford_2022_nation","container-title":"Gastronomica","DOI":"10.1525/gfc.2022.22.1.1","ISSN":"1529-3262, 1533-8622","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Nation and the Noodle: Indomie and Identity in Indonesia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/gastronomica/article/22/1/1/119745/The-Nation-and-the-NoodleIndomie-and-Identity-in","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"cline_2009_biblical","abstract":"From the Publisher: Public interest in biblical archaeology is at an all-time high, as television documentaries pull in millions of viewers to watch shows on the Exodus, the Ark of the Covenant, and the so-called Lost Tomb of Jesus. Important discoveries with relevance to the Bible are made virtually every year-during 2007 and 2008 alone researchers announced at least seven major discoveries in Israel, five of them in or near Jerusalem. Biblical Archaeology offers a passport into this fascinating realm, where ancient religion and modern science meet, and where tomorrow's discovery may answer a riddle that has lasted a thousand years. Archaeologist Eric H. Cline here offers a complete overview of this exciting field. He discusses the early pioneers, such as Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie and William Foxwell Albright, the origins of biblical archaeology as a discipline, and the major controversies that first prompted explorers to go in search of objects and sites that would \"prove\" the Bible. He then surveys some of the most well-known biblical archaeologists, including Kathleen Kenyon and Yigael Yadin, the sites that are essential sources of knowledge for biblical archaeology, such as Hazor, Megiddo, Gezer, Lachish, Masada, and Jerusalem, and some of the most important discoveries that have been made, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Mesha Inscription, and the Tel Dan Stele. Subsequent chapters examine additional archaeological finds that shed further light on the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, the issue of potential frauds and forgeries, including the James Ossuary and the Jehoash Tablet, and future prospects of the field.

  {"id":"cook_2018_typology","abstract":"The question of how best to classify Modern Standard Chinese loanwords is rather a fraught one. Various principles of categorization have been proposed in the literature; however, previous classification systems have generally covered only a relatively small proportion of all loanwords currently in use. Even attempts to provide an exhaustive catalog of lexical borrowing strategies have often been characterized by nontransparent structure, internal inconsistency or even incompleteness. This has hindered meaningful cross-linguistic comparisons of language change in Modern Standard Chinese vis-à-vis other languages. The aim of this paper is to present a new and clearly structured, comprehensive inventory of the different types of lexical borrowing that have occurred in Modern Standard Chinese over the past 30 to 40 years. Systematic cross-linguistic comparisons reveal that examples of almost all of the categories of lexical borrowing noted in the literature on English language change can likewise be provided in relation to Modern Standard Chinese. In addition, Chinese offers several options for borrowing lexical items not available to speakers of English. Overall, this paper presents a picture of Modern Standard Chinese speakers as cultivating a flexible, creative, playful approach to their use of language. The explicit recognition of the fact that many so-called “alphabetic words” are established loanwords is found to have implications for the typological classification of Chinese script, as well as for other fields such as second language teaching. A secondary finding not anticipated in the research question is that Chinese orthography shows tentative early signs of potentially developing from a morpho-logographic to a phonetic writing system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Cook","given":"Angela"}],"citation-key":"cook_2018_typology","container-title":"Lingua Sinica","container-title-short":"lingua. sin.","DOI":"10.1186/s40655-018-0038-7","ISSN":"2197-6678","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A typology of lexical borrowing in Modern Standard Chinese","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1186/s40655-018-0038-7","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"counts_1996_regum","abstract":"Although embalming is traditionally considered an Egyptian custom, ancient sources suggest that in imperial Rome the practice was not employed by Egyptians or Egyptianized Romans alone. The mos Romanorum in funerary ritual encompassed both cremation and inhumation, yet embalming appears in Rome as early as the first century AD and evidence points to its limited use during the first three centuries AD. Within the social structure of Rome's dead these preserved corpses certainly occupied a distinct place. Yet who were they and why were they embalmed? It is argued here that various factors allowed for the occasional use of embalming by Romans: (1) an apparent shift in attitudes towards Egypt, (2) the manipulation of death ritual for social distinction, and (3) the flexibility of the traditional Roman funeral, which was able to incorporate deviations in methods of body disposal. Although embalming has been largely ignored as a significant aspect of Roman funerary history, its patrons come from the classes of highest status, including even the imperial household. This fact alone makes it worthwhile to examine this small corpus of evidence. For example, the emperor Nero embalmed his wife Poppaea; such a deviation from standard disposal methods reflects imperial fashion, but also requires us to re-evaluate Nero's reign and, especially, the societal constructs of Neronian Rome. This study attempts to contextualize embalming within Roman society and offer some likely causes and effects of its use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Counts","given":"Derek B."}],"citation-key":"counts_1996_regum","container-title":"Classical Antiquity","DOI":"10.2307/25011039","ISSN":"0278-6656","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1996",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"189-202","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Regum Externorum Consuetudine: The Nature and Function of Embalming in Rome","title-short":"Regum Externorum Consuetudine","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://online.ucpress.edu/ca/article/15/2/189/25301/Regum-Externorum-Consuetudine-The-Nature-and","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"creed_2015_wine","abstract":"In the contemporary era, style is recognised as a significant feature of everyday language communication. Stylistic choices communicate meaning, attitude and emotion to an audience. This is no less true of the creative language used to taste and talk about wine. Wine discourse is rich in metaphorical expressions. As a stylistic device, metaphoric language frames meaning construction to evoke and construe images and emotions, and to elicit sensory perceptions and sensations of an aesthetic product. The language domain of wine is organised by an institutional framework—the genre of wine reviews—encompassing short, persuasive texts used by wine critics to convey their appraisal and appreciation of wine. In this paper I will consider the relationship between text structures, functions, and processes of metaphor in the genre of wine reviews given that meaning is situated in larger contexts of understanding. I present initial findings from a doctoral research project, using a cognitive linguistic theoretical and methodological framework of analysis, which examines the heuristic potential of Australian wine reviews across the cultural and linguistic borders of Australia and China. The paper concludes by highlighting the challenge of intercultural communication for wine education and business development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Creed","given":"Allison"}],"citation-key":"creed_2015_wine","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.1.2700.6886","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Unpublished","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Wine and metaphor: Stylistic choices within an institutional framework","title-short":"Wine and metaphor","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://rgdoi.net/10.13140/RG.2.1.2700.6886"},

  {"id":"croijmans_2020_uncovering","abstract":"Talking about odors and flavors is difficult for most people, yet experts appear to be able to convey critical information about wines in their reviews. This seems to be a contradiction, and wine expert descriptions are frequently received with criticism. Here, we propose a method for probing the language of wine reviews, and thus offer a means to enhance current vocabularies, and as a by-product question the general assumption that wine reviews are gibberish. By means of two different quantitative analyses—support vector machines for classification and Termhood analysis—on a corpus of online wine reviews, we tested whether wine reviews are written in a consistent manner, and thus may be considered informative; and whether reviews feature domain-specific language. First, a classification paradigm was trained on wine reviews from one set of authors for which the color, grape variety, and origin of a wine were known, and subsequently tested on data from a new author. This analysis revealed that, regardless of individual differences in vocabulary preferences, color and grape variety were predicted with high accuracy. Second, using Termhood as a measure of how words are used in wine reviews in a domain-specific manner compared to other genres in English, a list of 146 wine-specific terms was uncovered. These words were compared to existing lists of wine vocabulary that are currently used to train experts. Some overlap was observed, but there were also gaps revealed in the extant lists, suggesting these lists could be improved by our automatic analysis.","author":[{"family":"Croijmans","given":"Ilja"},{"family":"Hendrickx","given":"Iris"},{"family":"Lefever","given":"Els"},{"family":"Majid","given":"Asifa"},{"family":"Van Den Bosch","given":"Antal"}],"citation-key":"croijmans_2020_uncovering","container-title":"Natural Language Engineering","DOI":"10.1017/S1351324919000500","ISSN":"1351-3249","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"511-530","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Uncovering the Language of Wine Experts","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/uncovering-the-language-of-wine-experts/9BF0A599B49230297FD6DBA01F07C0DD","volume":"26"},

Our study provides the first, to our knowledge, archaeological evidence for an early Southeast Asian presence in Madagascar and reveals that this settlement extended to the Comoros. Our findings point to a complex Malagasy settlement history and open new research avenues for linguists, geneticists, and archaeologists to further study the timing and process of this population movement. They also provide insight into early processes of Indian Ocean biological exchange and in particular, Madagascar’s floral introductions, which account for one-tenth of its current vascular plant species diversity.\n          , \n            The Austronesian settlement of the remote island of Madagascar remains one of the great puzzles of Indo-Pacific prehistory. Although linguistic, ethnographic, and genetic evidence points clearly to a colonization of Madagascar by Austronesian language-speaking people from Island Southeast Asia, decades of archaeological research have failed to locate evidence for a Southeast Asian signature in the island’s early material record. Here, we present new archaeobotanical data that show that Southeast Asian settlers brought Asian crops with them when they settled in Africa. These crops provide the first, to our knowledge, reliable archaeological window into the Southeast Asian colonization of Madagascar. They additionally suggest that initial Southeast Asian settlement in Africa was not limited to Madagascar, but also extended to the Comoros. Archaeobotanical data may support a model of indirect Austronesian colonization of Madagascar from the Comoros and/or elsewhere in eastern Africa.","author":[{"family":"Crowther","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Lucas","given":"Leilani"},{"family":"Helm","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Horton","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Shipton","given":"Ceri"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Henry T."},{"family":"Walshaw","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Pawlowicz","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Radimilahy","given":"Chantal"},{"family":"Douka","given":"Katerina"},{"family":"Picornell-Gelabert","given":"Llorenç"},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Dorian Q."},{"family":"Boivin","given":"Nicole L."}],"citation-key":"crowther_2016_ancient","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"dafni_2019_medicinal","abstract":"Background: Previous lists number from 55 to 176 plant species as “Biblical Medicinal Plants.” Modern studies attest that many names on these lists are no longer valid. This situation arose due to old mistranslations and/or mistakes in botanical identification. Many previously recognized Biblical plants are in no way related to the flora of the Bible lands. Accordingly, the list needs revision.\nMethods: We re-examine the list of possible medicinal plants in the Bible based on new studies in Hebrew Biblical philology and etymology, new studies on the Egyptian and Mesopotamian medicinal use of plants, on ethnobotany and on archaeobotany.\nResults: In our survey, we suggest reducing this list to 45 plant species. Our contribution comprises 20 “newly” suggested Biblical Medicinal Plants. Only five species are mentioned directly as medicinal plants in the Bible: Fig (Ficus carica), Nard (Nardostachys jatamansi), Hyssop (Origanum syriacum), balm of Gilead (Commiphora gileadensis) and Mandrake (Mandragora officinarum). No fewer than 18 medicinal plants are mentioned in old Jewish postBiblical sources, in addition to those in the Bible. Most of these plants (15) are known also in Egypt and Mesopotamia while three are from Egypt only. Seven of our suggested species are not mentioned in the Bible or in the Jewish postBiblical literature but were recorded as medicinal plants from Egypt, as well as from Mesopotamia. It is quite logical to assume that they can be included as Biblical Medicinal Plants.\nConclusions: All our suggested Biblical Medicinal Plants are known as such in Ancient Egypt and/or Mesopotamia also. Examination of our list shows that all these plants have been in continuous medicinal use in the Middle East down the generations, as well as being used in the Holy Land today. Precisely in King Solomon’s words, “That which has been is what will be, that which is done is what will be done. And there is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Dafni","given":"Amots"},{"family":"Böck","given":"Barbara"}],"citation-key":"dafni_2019_medicinal","container-title":"Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine","container-title-short":"Journal of Ethnobiology Ethnomedicine","DOI":"10.1186/s13002-019-0338-8","ISSN":"1746-4269","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"57","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Medicinal plants of the Bible—revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13002-019-0338-8","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"dakin_2000_cacao","abstract":"The origin of the words ‘cacao’ and ‘chocolate’ and their use in the reconstruction of the early history of Mesoamerica, remain very controversial issues. Cambell and Kaufman (1976, American Antiquity 41:80–89), for example, proposed that the word ‘cacao’ originated from Mixe–Zoque languages, thus possibly representing Olmec traditions. According to this argument, other Mesoamerican languages, including Nahuatl, borrowed the word as a symbol of prestige and Olmec influence. Other researchers claim the word ‘chocolate’ represents a more recent neologism, a possible Maya–Nahuatl hybrid, due to the late appearance of the word in central Mexico’s Colonial sources. We refute the putative Mixe–Zoque origin of ‘cacao’ and provide linguistic evidence to propose that ‘cacao,’ like ‘chocolate,’ is a Uto-Aztecan term. Analysis of these words highlights general and particular evolutionary trends that originate from the Uto-Aztecan language family. In addition, we show that these two words were initially used as descriptive terms to refer to the shape of the plant’s bean and the techniques of drink preparation. Etymological evidence verifies the use of a Mayan term for cacao as early as the Classic period (fourth century a.d.). This early appearance of the term in Mayan and the later diffusion of the Nahua word throughout all of Mesoamerica correlate with additional data to support the conclusion that Teotihuacanos spoke Nahuatl.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dakin","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Wichmann","given":"Søren"}],"citation-key":"dakin_2000_cacao","container-title":"Ancient Mesoamerica","container-title-short":"Ancient Mesoam","DOI":"10.1017/S0956536100111058","ISSN":"0956-5361, 1469-1787","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1]]},"language":"en","page":"55-75","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Cacao and Chocolate: A Uto-Aztecan Perspective","title-short":"CACAO AND CHOCOLATE","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0956536100111058/type/journal_article","volume":"11"},

How will this linguistic extinction affect our lives? Is there a possibility that humanity will become a monolingual species? Should we care?\" \"Language in Danger is an historical investigation into the disappearance of languages and the consequences that future generations may face. Whether describing the effects of Latin's displacement of native languages in the aftermath of Rome's imperial expansion or the aggressive extermination of hundreds of indigenous North American languages through a brutal policy of forcing Native Americans to learn English, Dalby reveals that linguistic extinction has traditionally occurred as a result of economic inequality, political oppression, and even genocide. Bringing this historical perspective to bear on the uncertain fate of hundreds of pocket cultures - cultures whose languages are endangered by less obvious threats, such as multinational economic forces, immigration, nationalism, and global telecommunications - Language in Danger speaks out against the progressive silencing of our world's irreplaceable voices.\" \"More than an account of the decline of linguistic diversity, Language in Danger explains why humanity must protect its many unique tongues. Since all languages represent different ways of perceiving, mapping, and classifying the world, they act as repositories for cultural traditions and localized knowledge. The growing trend toward linguistic standarization - for example, politically designated national languages - threatens the existence of more marginalized cultures and ethnic customs, leaving only a few dominant tongues. The resulting languages become less flexible, nuanced, and inventive as they grow increasingly homogenized. Dalby argues that humanity needs linguistic variety not only to communicate, but to sustain and enhance our understanding of the world.\"–BOOK JACKET.","author":[{"family":"Dalby","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"dalby_2003_language","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"0-231-12900-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","title":"Language in danger: The loss of linguistic diversity and the threat to our future","type":"book"},

Indeed, Indian cotton and Chinese silk were probably the principal manufactured goods exchanged between these civilizations. Although Indian records are fragmentary, especially when compared with the voluminous Chinese sources, Indian cotton goods are known to have reached the Indianized states in Xinjiang in the early Common Era (CE), and may have been produced there, in Khotan and the neighbouring states, by the time that indigenous silk production was known to exist in India in the fourth and fifth centuries CE.

The East India Company's founding charter authorized it to \"wage war\" and it had always used violence to gain its ends. But the creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional international trading corporation dealing in silks and spices and became something much more unusual: an aggressive colonial power in the guise of a multinational business. In less than four decades it had trained up a security force of around 200,000 men--twice the size of the British army--and had subdued an entire subcontinent, conquering first Bengal and finally, in 1803, the Mughal capital of Delhi itself. The Company's reach stretched until almost all of India south of the Himalayas was effectively ruled from a boardroom in London. The Anarchy tells the remarkable story of how one of the world's most magnificent empires disintegrated and came to be replaced by a dangerously unregulated private company, based thousands of miles overseas in on small office, five windows wide, and answerable only to its distant shareholders. In his most ambitious and riveting book to date, William Dalrymple tells the story of the East India Company as it has never been told before, unfolding a timely cautionary tale of the first global corporate power. -- Dust jacket flap","author":[{"family":"Dalrymple","given":"William"}],"call-number":"941.073","citation-key":"dalrymple_2019_anarchy","event-place":"London (GB)","ISBN":"978-1-63557-433-3 978-1-4088-6440-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Bloomsbury Publishing","publisher-place":"London (GB)","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"The anarchy: the relentless rise of the East India Company","title-short":"The anarchy","type":"book"},

  {"id":"dankoff__turkish","abstract":"The Seyahatname or Book of Travels is the longest and fullest travel account in Islamic literature − perhaps in world literature. It is also a vast panorama of the Ottoman world in the mid−seventeenth century. The core is an autobiographical narrative, full of adventure and humor. The town descriptions cover not only topography and fortifications, with extensive descriptions of monuments and amenities, but extend to human geography − dress and cuisine, occupations and class structure, medicine and hygiene, naming practices, speech and reading habits, etc. − the social fabric of the city. The work is a mine of folklore, hagiography, dialectology, onomastics. It is a primary source for Ottoman imperial administration; for the social organization of the Sufi orders; for architectural history; for the role of dreams and portents in Ottoman daily life; and for much else besides. Indeed, it would be hard to overstate the importance of the Seyahatname for the study of the Ottoman Empire and of the early modern Middle East and the Balkans. Given its central importance, the fact that the bulk of it remains unedited, or poorly edited, is a source of frustration and even scandal.","author":[{"family":"Dankoff","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"dankoff__turkish","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Turkish Philology and Evliya Çelebi’s Book of Travels","type":"book"},

Their account of where and how cinnamon was obtained proves that exaggerated marketing techniques were not invented in the past. In spite of its widespread use, the origins of cinnamon was the Arab merchants’ best-kept secret until the early 10th century. To maintain their monopoly on cinnamon trade and justify its exorbitant price, Arab traders' interlaced colorful stories for their buyers about where and how they obtained the luxurious spice. Therefore, they furnished details on the origin of cinnamon which were not true.

These loanwords have become an important integral part of the lexicon of Chinese language and throughout decades have undergone assimilation, semantic extension and phonological adaptation. The present study is an investigation into the modes, levels and history of Sinicization of Indic loanwords in Chinese language. Fundamentally, it is evident from the literature and historical accounts that Sinicization of these loanwords is a process from foreignization to domestication. Native-Chinese doctrines and philosophies, essentially Taoism and Confucianism have had multifaceted influences on the Sinicization process which has resulted in semantic extension, semantic change or total diminution of original meaning. While less used high culture-sensitive loanwords have completely disappeared from modern Chinese, loanwords of higher Sinicization level have completely secularized. It is observed that foreignized loanwords have very less tendency of being absorbed into modern Chinese and many such terms have been excluded in modern Chinese dictionaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Dassanayake","given":"Noel"}],"citation-key":"dassanayake_2021_sinicization","container-title":"Macrolinguistics","container-title-short":"MACL","DOI":"10.26478/ja2021.9.15.6","ISSN":"19345755, 24736376","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,31]]},"language":"en","page":"112-130","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sinicization of Indic Loanwords in Chinese Language: Foreignization to domestication","title-short":"Sinicization of Indic Loanwords in Chinese Language","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://macrolinguistics.nju.edu.cn/language/b5/61/c47476a570721/page.htm","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"davies_2020_oxford","abstract":"The unique relationship between word and image in ancient Egypt is a defining feature of that ancient culture's records. All hieroglyphic texts are composed of images, and large-scale figural imagery in temples and tombs is often accompanied by texts. Epigraphy and palaeography are two distinct, but closely related, ways of recording, analyzing, and interpreting texts and images. This Handbook stresses technical issues about recording text and art and interpretive questions about what we do with those records and why we do it. It offers readers three key things: a diachronic perspective, covering all ancient Egyptian scripts from prehistoric Egypt through the Coptic era (fourth millennium BCE-first half of first millennium CE), a look at recording techniques0that considers the past, present, and future, and a focus on the experiences of colleagues. The diachronic perspective illustrates the range of techniques used to record different phases of writing in different media. The consideration of past, present, and future techniques allows readers to understand and assess why epigraphy and palaeography is or was done in a particular manner by linking the aims of a particular effort with the technique chosen to reach those aims. The choice of techniques is a matter of goals and the records' work circumstances, an inevitable consequence of epigraphy being a double projection: geometrical, transcribing in two dimensions an object that exists physically in three; and mental, an interpretation, with an inevitable selection among the object's defining characteristics. The experiences of colleagues provide a range of perspectives and opinions about issues such as techniques of recording, challenges faced in the field, and ways of reading and interpreting text and image.

  {"id":"declerck__pan","abstract":"In the context of the expanding Linked (Open) Data framework (LOD), work has started to encode linguistic resources in the same format as performed for the data sets present in the LOD, and which represent mainly domain specific knowledge. This approach has been extensively discussed in the W3C Ontology-Lexica Community Group, resulting in the “OntoLex” model, and is also being supported by the European LIDER project, leading for example to extensions of the recently created Linguistic Linked Open Data (LLOD) cloud, and by the European FREME project, applying LLOD principles to various industrial use cases. This development is highly relevant to the goals of the European Network of e-Lexicography (ENeL) COST action, and in this respect we performed a number of experiments to encode lexicographic data of various ENeL partners in a LLOD compliant format. We report in this paper on the first steps taken in the cooperation between ENeL and the other aforementioned projects, providing some detail regarding the encoding model we use: OntoLex.","author":[{"family":"Declerck","given":"Thierry"},{"family":"Wandl-Vogt","given":"Eveline"},{"family":"Mörth","given":"Karlheinz"}],"citation-key":"declerck__pan","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Towards a Pan European Lexicography by Means of Linked (Open) Data","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"deignan_1999_metaphorical","abstract":"The recent cognitive view of metaphor has implications for semantic relations between established metaphorical senses of polysemous Iexemes. It has been suggested that the relations of synonymy, antonymy and hyponymy holding between literal senses of lexemes may be replicated by their metaphorical senses. In this paper, lexemes with literal senses in the semantic areas of temperature, illness and tools are examined using concordance data from a large computerized corpus. Semantic relations between their literal and metaphorical senses are studied. It is concluded that semantic relations between literal senses are upheld between their metaphorical counterparts at the most general, abstract level, but that there are a number of inconsistencies when specific uses and collocational patterns are examined. The metaphorical senses of frequent lexemes such as hot or cold are less likely to behave predictably than the metaphorical senses of less frequent lexemes such as chilly or tepid, which often form semantic relationships that echo those of their literal senses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Deignan","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"deignan_1999_metaphorical","container-title":"<i>WORD</i>","container-title-short":"<i>WORD</i>","DOI":"10.1080/00437956.1999.11432491","ISSN":"0043-7956, 2373-5112","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",12]]},"language":"en","page":"319-338","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metaphorical polysemy and paradigmatic relations: A corpus study","title-short":"Metaphorical polysemy and paradigmatic relations","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00437956.1999.11432491","volume":"50"},

She tells a sweeping story that spans decades through the lives of her subjects, among them a princess whose family lost everything in the Cultural Revolution; a young student from a nomadic family who becomes radicalized in the storied monastery of Kirta; an upwardly mobile shopkeeper who falls in love with a Chinese woman; a poet and intellectual who risks everything to voice his resistance. Demick paints a broad canvas through an intimate view of these lives, depicting the tradition of resistance that results in the shocking acts of self-immolation, the vibrant, enduring power of Tibetan Buddhism, and the clash of modernity with ancient ways of life.

Beginning with Christopher Columbus's first observations of New World flora, the Spanish crown sought out spices to cultivate for economic gain. Although they were ultimately unsuccessful in efforts to generate a large-scale spice trade, colonial officials and local entrepreneurs participated in a coordinated program of empirical information gathering and botanical experimentation that is itself of historical significance. For the empirical and experimental–\"scientific\"–methods they represented serve to challenge and enhance current understanding of several historiographical themes: the origins of economic botany and the Scientific Revolution more generally, the role of human agency in the Columbian exchange, and the dissemination of knowledge from imperial centers to colonial peripheries.]","author":[{"family":"De Vos","given":"Paula"}],"citation-key":"devos_2006_science","container-title":"Journal of World History","ISSN":"10456007, 15278050","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"page":"399-427","title":"The Science of Spices: Empiricism and Economic Botany in the Early Spanish Empire","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20079398","volume":"17"},

We attempted to critically examine the sandal conservation efforts in India especially from a policy perspective, through a detailed review of the various Acts framed for conserving this resource and regulating its extraction and trade. Legal constraints that hamper private initiatives in ex situ sandal conservation/domestication and inconsistency in legal provisions related to sandal extraction and trade among the major producer states of southern India viz. Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala are the principal focus of this paper. The need for liberalization of the existing policy regime and evolution of a comprehensive management strategy for sandal, focusing on tree domestication and strengthening of in situ conservation measures backed by imaginative participatory management strategies, are highlighted.","author":[{"family":"Dhanya","given":"B"},{"family":"Viswanath","given":"Syam"},{"family":"Purushothman","given":"Seema"}],"citation-key":"dhanya__sandal","language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Sandal (Santalum album L.) conservation in southern India: A review of policies and their impacts","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"dioscorides_1100_fragments","abstract":"The Greek physician Dioscorides lived in the first century AD during the reign of the Emperor Nero. Dioscorides's five-volume treatise Perì üles iatrichès, commonly known in Latin as De materia medica (Of medical substances), is considered the most important medical manual and pharmacopeia of ancient Greece and Rome. It was highly regarded in the Middle Ages in both the Western and Arab worlds. It covers the therapeutic effectiveness of natural substances of animal, vegetable, and mineral origin. The manuscript presented here preserves fragments of an Arabic translation of Dioscorides's work. The work is known in Arabic under various titles, including Kitāb al-ḥashāʼish (The book of plants), Kitāb al-maqālāt al-khams (The five-essay book), or simply, as in this manuscript, Kitāb Disqūrīdis (Dioscorides's book). The first Arabic translation of Dioscorides's work was made by Istafan ibn Basil (Stephanos Basilos) and enhanced by his famed mentor Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-ʻIbadi (circa 809--73), who was tasked by Abbasid caliph al-Ma'mun to head the historic Bayt al-Hikmah (The House of Wisdom) in Baghdad. This manuscript was most likely copied in Upper Mesopotamia in the 12th century. The work is written in a beautiful naskhi script on parchment. It contains entries from all five books, beginning with plant-based ointments (Book I), and ending with wines and mineral-based potions (Book V). Folio 19 verso gives the name of Hisham ibn Musa ibn Yusuf as the scribe or, possibly, the translator. His title is given as al-masīḥī al-mutaṭabbib, suggesting he was a Christian herbalist. The manuscript is held in the National Library of France, together with two other, similar Arabic manuscripts on Dioscorides. The version preserved here differs from both. A printed text in French at the beginning, which dates from 1909, is a commentary on the colorful illustrations of plants and creatures in the manuscript. It is followed by handwritten notes comparing the differences in Arabic text in each translation, and enumerating the entries of plants and substances included in Dioscorides's work. \nSubject Headings\n    -  Greece \n    -  55 to 90 \n    -  Arabic manuscripts \n    -  Botany \n    -  Medicinal plants \n    -  Medicine, Ancient \n    -  Medicine, Greek and Roman \n    -  Naskh script \n    -  Plants \nNotes\n    -  Title devised, in English, by Library staff. \n    -  Original resource extent: 124 folios : illustrations ; 41 x 32 centimeters. \n    -  Original resource at: National Library of France. \n    -  Content in Arabic and French. \n    -  Description based on data extracted from World Digital Library, which may be extracted from partner institutions.","author":[{"family":"Dioscorides","given":"Pedanius of Anazarbos"}],"citation-key":"dioscorides_1100_fragments","event-place":"NA","issued":{"circa":true,"date-parts":[["1100"],["1200"]]},"language":"Arabic, French","publisher-place":"NA","source":"https://lccn.loc.gov/2021668182","title":"Fragments of the Treatise on Plants by Dioscorides","translator":[{"literal":"Hisham ibn Musa ibn Yusuf"}],"type":"book","URL":"https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.18415"},

Diyāb, a Maronite Christian, served as a guide and interpreter for the French naturalist and antiquarian Paul Lucas. Between 1706 and 1716, Diyāb and Lucas traveled through Syria, Cyprus, Egypt, Tripolitania, Tunis, Italy, and France. In Paris, Ḥanna Diyāb met Antoine Galland, who added to his wildly popular translation of The Thousand and One Nights several tales related by Diyāb, including \"Aladdin\" and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.\" When Lucas failed to make good on his promise of a position for Diyāb at Louis XIV's Royal Library, Diyāb returned to Aleppo. In his old age, he wrote this engaging account of his youthful adventures, from capture by pirates in the Mediterranean to quack medicine and near-death experiences.

  {"id":"don_2017_protoindoeuropean","abstract":"This book describes the earliest reconstructable stages of the prehistory of English, focusing specifically on linguistic structure. It outlines the grammar of Proto-Indo-European, considers the changes by which one dialect of that prehistoric language developed into Proto-Germanic, and provides a detailed account of the grammar of Proto-Germanic. In the course of his exposition Don Ringe draws on a long tradition of work on many languages, including Hittite, Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Slavic, Gothic, and Old Norse. This second edition has been significantly revised to provide a more in-depth account of Proto-Indo-European, with further exploration of disputed points; it has also been updated to include new developments in the field, particularly in the reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European verb and nominal inflection. The author also reconsiders some of his original approaches to specific linguistic changes and their relative chronology based on his recent research.","author":[{"family":"Don","given":"Ringe"}],"citation-key":"don_2017_protoindoeuropean","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-879258-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","title":"From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic","type":"book"},

We explore this seeming infelicity to study the nature of linguistic conceptualization. We focus on variations and changes of the morphosemantic behaviors of weather words in Mandarin and other Sinitic languages with an interdisciplinary approach to establish links between linguistic expressions and scientific facts. We propose that this use of directionality is the result of conventionalization of Chinese people?s inference from shared daily experience, and is well motivated in terms of a linguistic ontology that reflects a scientific account of natural phenomena. We further demonstrate that the semantically relevant orthography shared by Chinese speakers can be directly mapped to Hantology, a formal linguistic ontology based on Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). In this mapping, the radical ? y? ?rain,? derived from the ideograph of ?rain? to represent atmospheric water, provides crucial clues to the use of directional verbs and the parts of speech of weather words. Our findings also lend support to language-based reconstruction of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and lay foundation for TEK research in the Sinosphere.","author":[{"family":"Dong","given":"Sicong"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yike"},{"family":"Ren","given":"He"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"dong_2021_directionality","container-title":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244020988293","ISSN":"2158-2440","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"2158244020988293","publisher":"SAGE Publications","title":"Directionality of Atmospheric Water in Chinese: A Lexical Semantic Study Based on Linguistic Ontology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2158244020988293","volume":"11"},

This series of interconnected essays and lectures surveys the most critically important and hotly contested issues in Hinduism over 3,500 years, from the ancient time of the Vedas to the present day. The essays contemplate the nature of Hinduism; Hindu concepts of divinity; attitudes concerning gender, control, and desire; the question of reality and illusion; and the impermanent and the eternal in the two great Sanskrit epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Among the questions Doniger considers are: Are Hindus monotheists or polytheists? How can atheists be Hindu, and how can unrepentant Hindu sinners find salvation? Why have Hindus devoted so much attention to the psychology of addiction? What does the significance of dogs and cows tell us about Hinduism? How have Hindu concepts of death, rebirth, and karma changed over the course of history? How and why does a pluralistic faith, remarkable for its intellectual tolerance, foster religious intolerance? Doniger concludes with four concise autobiographical essays in which she reflects on her lifetime of scholarship, Hindu criticism of her work, and the influence of Hinduism on her own philosophy of life.

  {"id":"duffy_2000_food","abstract":"Objective To determine if individuals who taste 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), one marker of genetic variation in taste, as exceptionally bitter can also perceive sugars as sweeter, other bitters as more intense, and dietary fats as more creamy and/or viscous than do individuals who taste PROP as weakly bitter. This study examined the association between genetic variation in taste and acceptance for sweet, high-fat, and bitter foods and beverages. Design Genetic variation was measured by perceived bitterness of PROP. (influenced by genetic, hormonal, and pathologic factors) and density of fungi form papillae on the anterior portion of the tongue (influenced primarily by genetic factors). Four sweet, 3 fat, and 3 bitter groups were derived from principal components analyses of questionnaire items. Subjects Convenience sample of healthy adults (24 women, 22 men; mean age±standard deviation=21±6 years) who did not report high dietary restraint. Statistical analyses Pearson product moment correlations between genetic taste measures and food and beverage groups. Results The sample showed diversity in genetic taste measures: perceived bitterness of 0.0032mol/L PROP ranged from “weak” to well above “very strong”; fungi form papillae densities ranged from 33 to 156 papillae per square centimeter. Distribution of perceived bitterness of PROP and fungi form papillae density differed in women and men. The association between genetic taste measures and acceptance of sweet and high-fat groups differed in women and men. In women, liking of sweet and high-fat food and beverage groups decreased with increasing perceived bitterness of PROP. In men, liking of these foods and beverages increased but with increasing papillae densities. Genetic taste measures were not associated with a dislike of bitter food and beverage groups. Applications The influence of genetic variation in taste on food intake depends on how perceptible sweet, fat, or bitter components are in foods and beverages, as well as the value of sensory factors vs other factors (eg, health, convenience) on personal dietary choices.

This Element shows how text classification and text similarity models can extend our ability to undertake corpus linguistics across very large corpora. These computational methods are becoming increasingly important as corpora grow too large for more traditional types of linguistic analysis. We draw on five case studies to show how and why to use computational methods, ranging from usage-based grammar to authorship analysis to using social media for corpus-based sociolinguistics. Each section is accompanied by an interactive code notebook that shows how to implement the analysis in Python. A stand-alone Python package is also available to help readers use these methods with their own data.

  {"id":"durkin_2015_oxford","abstract":"This book provides a guide to the most significant contours in the geography of the lexicographical world, as well as offering series of eye-witness accounts of the major issues confronting lexicographers and the users of dictionaries today. Part I considers the synchronic dictionary, and especially three characteristic types: (1) the dictionary for the general readership (many peoples conception of the dictionary); (2) the monolingual dictionary intended for L2 learners; and (3) the bilingual dictionary. These are placed together so that, after their distinctive features have been set out, common areas of methodology can be considered together, in particular the central role of the corpus in lexicography of this type today. Such dictionaries are normally also synchronic, and are typically intended for a mass market, and produced by commercial publishers. Part II deals with historical dictionaries, typically edited within an academic institution and published by an academic press, and typically intended for a more specialist readership. A diachronic perspective produces particular structural and presentational challenges, so that one can identify methods and procedures that distinguish diachronic lexicography from synchronic lexicography. In Part III a set of slightly shorter chapters examine some of the most important types of specialist dictionaries and their salient qualities and methodologies, focusing on what sets each area apart, but also on the perspectives it brings to the wider lexicographical world. Part IV examines some topics common to various different types of lexicography, and some of the challenges and debates that cross the boundaries of sub-fields.","author":[{"family":"Durkin","given":"Philip"}],"citation-key":"durkin_2015_oxford","event-place":"Oxford","ISBN":"978-0-19-969163-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"publisher":"Oxford University Press","publisher-place":"Oxford","title":"The Oxford handbook of lexicography","type":"book"},

But for many of its advocates from the 1770s to the 1850s it was also the world's most enlightened one. Joshua Ehrlich reveals that a commitment to knowledge was integral to the Company's ideology. He shows how the Company cited this commitment in defense of its increasingly fraught union of commercial and political power. He moves beyond studies of orientalism, colonial knowledge, and information with a new approach: the history of ideas of knowledge. He recovers a world of debate among the Company's officials and interlocutors, Indian and European, on the political uses of knowledge. Not only were these historical actors highly articulate on the subject but their ideas continue to resonate in the present. Knowledge was a fixture in the politics of the Company – just as it seems to be becoming a fixture in today's politics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Ehrlich","given":"Joshua"}],"citation-key":"ehrlich_2023_easta","DOI":"10.1017/9781009367967","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-00-936796-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,6]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The East India Company and the Politics of Knowledge","type":"book","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/9781009367967/type/book"},
  {"id":"ehrlinger__definition","abstract":"Recently, the term knowledge graph has been used frequently in research and business, usually in close association with Semantic Web technologies, linked data, large-scale data analytics and cloud computing. Its popularity is clearly inﬂuenced by the introduction of Google’s Knowledge Graph in 2012, and since then the term has been widely used without a deﬁnition. A large variety of interpretations has hampered the evolution of a common understanding of knowledge graphs. Numerous research papers refer to Google’s Knowledge Graph, although no oﬃcial documentation about the used methods exists. The prerequisite for widespread academic and commercial adoption of a concept or technology is a common understanding, based ideally on a deﬁnition that is free from ambiguity. We tackle this issue by discussing and deﬁning the term knowledge graph, considering its history and diversity in interpretations and use. Our goal is to propose a deﬁnition of knowledge graphs that serves as basis for discussions on this topic and contributes to a common vision.","author":[{"family":"Ehrlinger","given":"Lisa"},{"family":"Wöß","given":"Wolfram"}],"citation-key":"ehrlinger__definition","language":"en","page":"4","source":"Zotero","title":"Towards a Deﬁnition of Knowledge Graphs","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"elshamsy_2020_rediscovering","abstract":"\"Historians have traced the traditions of Islamic scholarship back to late antiquity. Muslim scholars were at work as early as 750 CE/AD, painstakingly copying their commentaries and legal opinions onto scrolls and codices. This venerable tradition embraced the modern printing press relatively late-movable type was adopted in the Middle East only in the early nineteenth century. Islamic scholars, however, initially kept their distance from the new technology, and it was not until the end of the nineteenth century that the first published editions of works of classical religious scholarship began to appear in print. As the culture of print took root, both popular and scholarly understandings of the Islamic tradition shifted. Particular religious works were soon read precisely because they were available in printed, published editions. Other equally erudite works still in scroll and manuscript form, by contrast, languished in the obscurity of manuscript repositories. The people who selected, edited, and published the new print books on and about Islam exerted a huge influence on the resulting literary tradition. These unheralded editors determined, essentially, what came to be understood by the early twentieth century as the classical written \"canon\" of Islamic thought. Collectively, this relatively small group of editors who brought Islamic literature into print crucially shaped how Muslim intellectuals, the Muslim public, and various Islamist movements understood the Islamic intellectual tradition. In this book Ahmed El Shamsy recounts this sea change, focusing on the Islamic literary culture of Cairo, a hot spot of the infant publishing industry, from the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. As El Shamsy argues, the aforementioned editors included some of the greatest minds in the Muslim world and shared an ambitious intellectual agenda of revival, reform, and identity formation. This book tells the stories of the most consequential of these editors as well as their relations and intellectual exchanges with the European orientalists who also contributed to the new Islamic print culture\"--","author":[{"family":"El Shamsy","given":"Ahmed"}],"call-number":"Z466.E486","citation-key":"elshamsy_2020_rediscovering","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-20124-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Rediscovering the Islamic classics: How editors and print culture transformed an intellectual tradition","title-short":"Rediscovering the islamic classics","type":"book"},

Bubbly, as we affectionately call it, is a symbol of luxury and decadence and the go-to drink whenever there is an important toast. This history from Becky Sue Epstein is a celebration of the world's most celebratory drink. Here, Epstein chronicles champagne's story, from the world's first sparkling wine, produced in Limoux, Languedoc, in 1531 by monks at an abbey in Saint-Hilaire to the celebrities who made champagnes famous and continue to do so today-- from Dom Perignon to the widow Veuve Cliquot. Most important, Epstein fully explains the distinction between champagne and sparkling wine. In this informative chronicle, she answers whether French champagne is really better than other sparkling wines and elucidates the science behind that characteristic fizz and bubble. She takes the reader on a tour of vineyards in wine regions around the world and teaches the correct techniques for storing and serving champagne and sparkling wines. Whether you prefer magnums of Cristal or the affordable thrill of Cold Duck, Champagne is an invaluable complement to any bubbly glass and an informative, elegant gift for connoisseurs, beginners, and wine lovers of all kinds\"--Provided by publisher.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Epstein","given":"Becky Sue"}],"citation-key":"epstein_2011_champagne","collection-title":"Edible","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-86189-963-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 767502736","publisher":"Reaktion Books","publisher-place":"London","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Champagne: a global history","title-short":"Champagne","type":"book","URL":"http://www.dawsonera.com/depp/reader/protected/external/AbstractView/S9781861899637"},

  {"id":"eriksson_2012_genetic","abstract":"The leaves of the Coriandrum sativum plant, known as cilantro or coriander, are widely used in many cuisines around the world. However, far from being a benign culinary herb, cilantro can be polarizing---many people love it while others claim that it tastes or smells foul, often like soap or dirt. This soapy or pungent aroma is largely attributed to several aldehydes present in cilantro. Cilantro preference is suspected to have a genetic component, yet to date nothing is known about specific mechanisms. Here we present the results of a genome-wide association study among 14,604 participants of European ancestry who reported whether cilantro tasted soapy, with replication in a distinct set of 11,851 participants who declared whether they liked cilantro. We find a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with soapy-taste detection that is confirmed in the cilantro preference group. This SNP, rs72921001, (p=6.4e-9, odds ratio 0.81 per A allele) lies within a cluster of olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11. Among these olfactory receptor genes is OR6A2, which has a high binding specificity for several of the aldehydes that give cilantro its characteristic odor. We also estimate the heritability of cilantro soapy-taste detection in our cohort, showing that the heritability tagged by common SNPs is low, about 0.087. These results confirm that there is a genetic component to cilantro taste perception and suggest that cilantro dislike may stem from genetic variants in olfactory receptors. We propose that OR6A2 may be the olfactory receptor that contributes to the detection of a soapy smell from cilantro in European populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shirley"},{"family":"Do","given":"Chuong B."},{"family":"Kiefer","given":"Amy K."},{"family":"Tung","given":"Joyce Y."},{"family":"Mountain","given":"Joanna L."},{"family":"Hinds","given":"David A."},{"family":"Francke","given":"Uta"}],"citation-key":"eriksson_2012_genetic","container-title":"arXiv:1209.2096 [q-bio]","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",9,10]]},"language":"en","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A genetic variant near olfactory receptor genes influences cilantro preference","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2096"},

All product experiences rely on information from sensory modalities. We developed a questionnaire approach to quantify the relative importance of the ﬁve sensory modalities for various descriptors of product experience. The approach was used in two studies that employed Dutch and Russian participants. The results demonstrate that the importance of a sensory modality differs for various groups of descriptors. Most symbolic descriptors demonstrated strong visual dominance. Affective descriptors were equally related to all sensory modalities. Sensory descriptors showed signiﬁcant cross-cultural differences. The latter result can be explained by the different associations between literal and metaphorical meanings of sensory adjectives in different languages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Fenko","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Otten","given":"Jacco J."},{"family":"Schifferstein","given":"Hendrik N.J."}],"citation-key":"fenko_2010_describing","container-title":"Journal of Pragmatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2010.05.010","ISSN":"03782166","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"language":"en","page":"3314-3327","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Describing product experience in different languages: The role of sensory modalities","title-short":"Describing product experience in different languages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378216610001724","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"ferrence_2004_therapy","abstract":"This paper presents a new interpretation of a unique Bronze Age (c. 3000–1100 BCE) Aegean wall painting in the building of Xeste 3 at Akrotiri,Thera. Crocus cartwrightianus and its active principle, saffron, are the primary subjects at Xeste 3. Several lines of evidence suggest that the meaning of these frescoes concerns saffron and healing: (1) the unusual degree of visual attention given to the crocus, including the variety of methods for display of the stigmas; (2) the painted depiction of the line of saffron production from plucking blooms to the collection of stigmas; and (3) the sheer number (ninety) of medical indications for which saffron has been used from the Bronze Age to the present.The Xeste 3 frescoes appear to portray a divinity of healing associated with her phytotherapy, saffron. Cultural and commercial interconnections between the Therans, the Aegean world, and their neighboring civilizations in the early 2nd millennium BCE indicate a close network of thematic exchange, but there is no evidence that Akrotiri borrowed any of these medicinal (or iconographic) representations.The complex production line, the monumental illustration of a goddess of medicine with her saffron attribute, and this earliest botanically accurate image of an herbal medication are all Theran innovations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrence","given":"Susan C."},{"family":"Bendersky","given":"Gordon"}],"citation-key":"ferrence_2004_therapy","container-title":"Perspectives in Biology and Medicine","container-title-short":"Perspectives in Biology and Medicine","DOI":"10.1353/pbm.2004.0026","ISSN":"1529-8795","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"199-226","title":"Therapy with Saffron and the Goddess at Thera","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://muse.jhu.edu/content/crossref/journals/perspectives_in_biology_and_medicine/v047/47.2ferrence.html","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"florida_1995_writing","abstract":"Located at the juncture of literature, history, and anthropology, Writing the Past, Inscribing the Future charts a strategy of how one might read a traditional text of non-Western historical literature in order to generate, with it, an opening for the future. This book does so by taking seriously a haunting work of historical prophecy inscribed in the nineteenth century by a royal Javanese exile-working through this writing of a colonized past to suggest the reconfiguration of the postcolonial future that this history itself apparently intends. After introducing the colonial and postcolonial orientalist projects that would fix the meaning of traditional writing in Java, Nancy K. Florida provides a nuanced translation of this particular traditional history, a history composed in poetry as the dream of a mysterious exile. She then undertakes a richly textured reading of the poem that discloses how it manages to escape the fixing of \"tradition.\" Adopting a dialogic strategy of reading, Florida writes to extend-as the work's Javanese author demands-this history's prophetic potential into a more global register. Babad Jaka Tingkir, the historical prophecy that Writing the Past, Inscribing the Future translates and reads, is uniquely suited for such a study. Composing an engaging history of the emergence of Islamic power in central Java around the turn of the sixteenth century, Babad Jaka Tingkir was written from the vantage of colonial exile to contest the more dominant dynastic historical traditions of nineteenth-century court literature. Florida reveals how this history's episodic form and focus on characters at the margins of the social order work to disrupt the genealogical claims of conventional royal historiography-thus prophetically to open the possibility of an alternative future.","author":[{"family":"Florida","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"florida_1995_writing","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv11314px","ISBN":"978-0-8223-1605-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"publisher":"Duke University Press","title":"Writing the past: Inscribing the future history as prophecy in colonial Java","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv11314px"},

The case study is an ancient traveling narrative, Pausanias’s Description of Greece (Periegesis Hellados) which was written in the second century CE. First, we describe the process of converting the volumes to spatial data using a customized version of the open-source digital semantic annotation platform Recogito. Then the focus shifts to the implementation of collected and organized spatial data to a number of GIS applications: namely Google Maps, DARIAH Geo-Browser, Gephi, Palladio and ArcGIS. Through empirical experimentation with spatial data and their implementation in different platforms, our paper charts the ways in which contemporary GIS applications may be implemented to cast new light on ancient understandings of identity, space, and place.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Foka","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Demiroglu","given":"Osman Cenk"},{"family":"Barker","given":"Elton"},{"family":"Mostofian","given":"Nasrin"},{"family":"Konstantinidou","given":"Kyriaki"},{"family":"Kiesling","given":"Brady"},{"family":"Talatas","given":"Linda"},{"family":"Palm","given":"Kajsa"}],"citation-key":"foka_2022_visualizing","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqab093","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,23]]},"language":"en","page":"716-724","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visualizing Pausanias’s Description of Greece with contemporary GIS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/37/3/716/6439579","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"foltz_2008_muslim","abstract":"Since the late 1970s the term \"orientalism\" has most often been used to assert the existence of an exoticised, romanticised and often hegemonic European view of the non-Western Other. A similar approach can be seen in travelogues of India written by Middle Eastern and Central Asian Muslims during the pre-modern period.

  {"id":"fonsing_2017_creoles","abstract":"Typological approaches involving the study of Creole languages have long triggered an unsettled dispute among creolists. Some claim that Creoles do not differ from non-Creole languages, and can only be defined socio-historically and not structurally, while others claim that Creoles are “distinct” in many respects, and/or form a special class with specific typological properties. In an attempt to settle this dispute, Bakker et al. (2011) drew on a phylogenetic approach to provide evidence that Creoles form a structurally distinguishable subgroup within the world’s languages. However, their methods and conclusions appear to be questionable, as they are likely to be flawed. Standing as a challenge to the aforementioned article, this paper will reconsider their methodological and empirical approaches by re-evaluating the sets of Creoles and non-Creoles on the basis of identical or near-identical principles. It will ultimately appear that their conclusion could be an artefact of the selection as well.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Fon Sing","given":"Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"fonsing_2017_creoles","container-title":"Language Ecology","container-title-short":"LE","DOI":"10.1075/le.1.1.04fon","ISSN":"2452-1949, 2452-2147","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7,13]]},"language":"en","page":"44-74","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Creoles are not typologically distinct from non-Creoles","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/le.1.1.04fon","volume":"1"},

There is therefore a new need for ﬁne-grained, large-coverage and accurate etymological lexical resources. In this paper, we propose a set of guidelines to generate such resources, for each step of the life-cycle of an etymological lexicon: creation, update, evaluation, dissemination, and exploitation. To illustrate the guidelines, we introduce EtymDB 2.0, an etymological database automatically generated from the Wiktionary, which contains 1.8 million lexemes, linked by more than 700,000 ﬁne-grained etymological relations, across 2,536 living and dead languages. We also introduce use cases for which EtymDB 2.0 could represent a key resource, such as phylogenetic tree generation, low resource machine translation and medieval languages study.","author":[{"family":"Fourrier","given":"Clémentine"},{"family":"Sagot","given":"Benoît"}],"citation-key":"fourrier__methodological","language":"en","page":"11","source":"Zotero","title":"Methodological Aspects of Developing and Managing an Etymological Lexical Resource: Introducing EtymDB 2.0","type":"article-journal"},

In addition spices provided an image of wellness and as they were expensive and had many uses in cuisine and fragrance, they functioned as prestige consumer goods. Materials and methods This is an effort to look historically at a social and cultural phenomenon for the period roughly A.D. 1200–1500. Sources of information about the demand for and uses of spices include lists of materia medica, medical treatises, cookbooks, religious writings, descriptions of banquets and court ceremonial and literary works showing what might be called aspirational lifestyles. Results It is important to focus on the demand side of the spice trade rather than simply assuming a consistent demand and looking only at the supply (prices, routes, for example). Conclusions The demand for spices must be understood in terms of their attributed medical and wellness powers, but these in turn are related to the mysterious Eastern origins of spices that enhanced their image as elite consumer products and their association with spiritual as well as medical healing.","author":[{"family":"Freedman","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"freedman_2015_health","container-title":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2014.10.065","ISSN":"0378-8741","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"47-53","title":"Health, Wellness and the Allure of Spices in the Middle Ages","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874114008058","volume":"167"},

  {"id":"friese_2011_chasing","abstract":"Chasing Chiles looks at both the future of place-based foods and the effects of climate change on agriculture through the lens of the chile pepper-from the farmers who cultivate this iconic crop to the cuisines and cultural traditions in which peppers play a huge role. Why chile peppers? Both a spice and a vegetable, chile peppers have captivated imaginations and taste buds for thousands of years. Native to Mesoamerica and the New World, chiles are currently grown on every continent, since their relatively recent introduction to Europe (in the early 1500s via Christopher Columbus). Chiles are delicious, dynamic, and very diverse-they have been rapidly adopted, adapted, and assimilated into numerous world cuisines, and while malleable to a degree, certain heirloom varieties are deeply tied to place and culture-but now accelerating climate change may be scrambling their terroir. Over a year-long journey, three pepper-loving gastronauts-an agroecologist, a chef, and an ethnobotanist-set out to find the real stories of America's rarest heirloom chile varieties, and learn about the changing climate from farmers and other people who live by the pepper, and who, lately, have been adapting to shifting growing conditions and weather patterns. They put a face on an issue that has been made far too abstract for our own good.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Friese","given":"Kurt Michael"},{"family":"Kraft","given":"Kraig"},{"family":"Nabhan","given":"Gary Paul"}],"citation-key":"friese_2011_chasing","event-place":"White River Junction, Vermont","ISBN":"978-1-60358-375-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"English","note":"OCLC: 894237955","publisher":"Chelsea Green Publishing","publisher-place":"White River Junction, Vermont","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Chasing chiles: Hot spots along the pepper trail","title-short":"Chasing chiles","type":"book","URL":"https://archive.org/details/chasingchileshot0000frie"},

I explore the third point in this dissertation. In particular, I seek to explain the role of the k e n to s h i with regard to a maritime trade network that developed in East Asia. I examine the voyages the kentoshi made, as well as the exchanges the missions conducted while in China. I begin with a study of the navigational challenges the Japanese faced and the ocean going vessels they constructed. As a part of this, I survey Japan’s maritime history, from evidence of the first water craft in Japan to the development of k o zo se n boats, or composite vessels. I next turn to the question of the trade itself. I categorize the exchange between Japan and the continent as “imperial,” “elite,” and “private.” Imperial trade refers to the tributary exchanges conducted by the envoys dispatched through official government channels in the names of the respective Courts. Elite trade, often concurrent with imperial trade, was conducted by the individual members of official diplomatic missions through government channels or under the jurisdiction of agencies such as the D iankeshu Office in Tang China and the Treasury M inistry and Palace Storehouse Bureau in Japan. Private trade, in contrast, was carried out by merchants. These merchants often traded with representatives of the government or iv Reproduced with permission of the copyright owner. Further reproduction prohibited without permission\n\nrepresentatives of the ruling classes; i.e., the wealthy and powerful elites. In this dissertation I also use archaeology to better understand trade with the continent. The most common vessels imported to Japan were white-glazed ceramics from Hebei Province, celadon from the kilns in Hunan Province, and Yue celadon produced primarily in Zhejiang. I believe trade was more important to the kentoshi than heretofore discussed in the English language literature. In the ninth century, merchant activity began to supercede the trading function of the official embassies, rendering them obsolete. This is true, not only of trade between Japan and Tang, but between Japan and Silla as well. This is not true, however, in the case of Bohai.","author":[{"family":"Fuqua","given":"Douglas Sherwin"}],"citation-key":"fuqua_2004_japanese","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"publisher":"University of Hawaii","title":"The Japanese missions to Tang China and maritime exchange in East Asia, 7th-9th centuries","type":"thesis"},

Making Levantine Cuisine provides much-needed scholarly attention to the region's culinary cultures while teasing apart the tangled histories and knotted migrations of food. Akin to the region itself, the culinary repertoires that comprise Levantine cuisine endure and transform--are unified but not uniform.

The histories of these ingredients and dishes, now so emblematic of the Levant, reveal the processes that codified them as national foods, the faulty binaries of Arab or Jewish and traditional or modern, and the global nature of foodways.

  {"id":"gaynor_2012_piracy","abstract":"[This article uses the offing as a metaphor to theorize piracy in relation to pivotal moments in Southeast Asia's maritime engagement with the world. \"In the offing\" usually indicates that something is about to happen. This figurative meaning derives from a literal one that refers to the visible sea beyond inshore navigational hazards. Nautically apt, the offing's literal sense also provides a useful metaphor for analyzing piracy. Like the physical location of the offing, piracy entails both an embodied orientation as well as a more general relation of structured perceptions between those aboard ship and those on shore. Yet shore-based political authorities have had an inordinate power to define what counts as piracy and who is determined to be a pirate. While designations of piracy illuminate the efforts of states to manage the limits of their sovereignty, the boundary between legitimate plunder and that which is not has often been negotiated across social arenas in which legal (and other) legitimacies are differentially acknowledged. Like the space of the offing, acts that might be considered piracy and those who do them thus entail questions of definition, visibility, and point of view—matters that for piracy unfold in relation to particular configurations of politics, power, and cultural comprehension. The question of piracy comes under scrutiny here in three such configurations: first, in the relations between Southeast Asian polities and between them and China during the 15th century; second, in the context of early 17th century Dutch trade in Southeast Asia along with the European political and legal setting; and third, in connection with 19th century views on piracy's proliferation in the region and inter-colonial attempts to curb it. This analysis informs a discussion of infamous ethnic names that signified \"pirates\" in colonial European and Southeast Asian discourses. It then also anchors critical observations about contemporary piracy and the notion of failed states.]","author":[{"family":"Gaynor","given":"Jennifer L."}],"citation-key":"gaynor_2012_piracy","container-title":"Anthropological Quarterly","ISSN":"00035491, 15341518","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"817-857","title":"Piracy in the Offing: The Law of Lands and The Limits of Sovereignty at Sea","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/41857272","volume":"85"},

  {"id":"gert_1995_family","abstract":"In §66 of Philosophical h~vestigations Wittgenstein looks for something common to various games and finds only an interconnecting network of resemblances. These are \"family resemblances\". Sympathetic as well as unsympathetic readers have interpreted him as claiming that games form a family in virtue of these resemblances. This assumes Wittgenstein inverted the relation between being a member of a family and bearing family resemblances to others of that family. (The Churchills bear family resemblances to one another because they belong to the same family, they don't belong to the same family because they resemble one another.) A close reading of Investigations gives no evidence that Wittgenstein made this mistake. Rather, family resemblances may play a role like the one criteria play for psychological terms. They give excellent but fallible evidence for membership in the extensions of some terms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Gert","given":"Heather J."}],"citation-key":"gert_1995_family","container-title":"Synthese","container-title-short":"Synthese","DOI":"10.1007/BF01064217","ISSN":"0039-7857, 1573-0964","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995",11]]},"language":"en","page":"177-190","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Family resemblances and criteria","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/BF01064217","volume":"105"},

Recent organic residue analyses performed on small early Iron Age (11th–late 10th century BCE) Phoenician clay flasks provide the first concrete archaeological evidence that such sustainable trade took place much earlier than hitherto suspected. The analysis shows that several of the flasks contained cinnamon, which in this period could only have originated in South/Southeast Asia. Here, we first summarize the rationale and results of that study. Subsequently, we provide an updated review of all sources of data relevant to the question at hand—archaeological, analytical, and textual.

We design a simple computer model following the Pólya-urn dynamics to evaluate possible effects of linguistic, individual learning, and socio-cultural factors on linguistic diffusion. Simulation results and statistical analyses collectively reveal that: variant prestige, rather than individual bias, is a fundamental selective pressure for diffusion; given variant prestige, speaker’s and hearer’s preferences for prestigious variants show different degrees of efficiency on diffusion; and structural features of social network, such as average degree and level of centrality, also modulate the degree of diffusion. This work offers an interdisciplinary approach to study linguistic diffusion and modify available theories and simulations concerning individual learning or social factors. 人类语言不断变化。很多变化是通过在ー组交流个体中扩散不同形式的语言变体完成的。我们设计了一个基于Pólya-urn动态的简单计算机模型研究语言、个体学习和社会-文化因素对语言扩散可能起的作用。模拟結果和统计分析表明：（1) 对变体的偏好，而不是对使用者的偏好，是决定扩散的基本选择要素；在存在变体偏好情况下，（2) 说者和听者对变体的偏好具有不同程度的扩散效率；（3) 网络结构因素， 如平均度和集中度，可调节扩散程度。此工作为研究语言扩散提供了ー个跨学科手段，并改进了已有的关于个体和社会因素对语言扩散影 响的理论和模拟研究。]","author":[{"family":"Gong","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Shuai","given":"Lan"},{"literal":"龚涛"},{"literal":"帅兰"}],"citation-key":"gong_2017_using","container-title":"Journal of Chinese Linguistics Monograph Series","DOI":"10.2307/26455327","ISSN":"24092878","issue":"27","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"86-104","title":"Using computer simulation to study linguistic diffusion / 用模拟仿真研究语言扩散","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26455327"},

Silk weaving is evident from the Shang period c. 1600–1045 BC, though the earliest evidence for silk textiles in ancient China may date to as much as a millennium earlier. Recent microscopic analysis of archaeological thread fragments found inside copper-alloy ornaments from Harappa and steatite beads from Chanhu-daro, two important Indus sites, have yielded silk ﬁbres, dating to c. 2450–2000 BC. This study offers the earliest evidence in the world for any silk outside China, and is roughly contemporaneous with the earliest Chinese evidence for silk.

Stewart Gordon has fashioned a look at Asia from A.D. 700 to 1500, a time when Asia was the world, by describing the personal journeys of Asia's many travelers–the merchants who traded spices along the Silk Road, the apothecaries who exchanged medicine and knowledge from China to the Middle East, and the philosophers and holy men who crossed continents to explore and exchange ideas, books, science, and culture.–From publisher description.","author":[{"family":"Gordon","given":"Stewart"}],"citation-key":"gordon_2008_when","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-306-81729-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"Da Capo Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","title":"When Asia was the world","type":"book","URL":"http://site.ebrary.com/id/10469215"},

  {"id":"graeber_2021_dawn","abstract":"A trailblazing account of human history, challenging our most fundamental assumptions about social evolution--from the development of agriculture and cities to the emergence of \"the state,\" political violence, and social inequality--and revealing new possibilities for human emancipation. For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike--either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, democracy, slavery, and civilization itself. Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off our conceptual shackles and perceive what's really there. If humans did not spend 95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, than we tend to assume. The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

  {"id":"green_2019_persianate","abstract":"Persian is one of the great lingua francas of world history. Yet despite its recognition as a shared language across the Islamic world and beyond, its scope, impact, and mechanisms remain underexplored. A world historical inquiry into pre-modern cosmopolitanism, The Persianate World traces the reach and limits of Persian as a Eurasian language in a comprehensive survey of its geographical, literary, and social frontiers. From Siberia to Southeast Asia, and between London and Beijing, this book shows how Persian gained, maintained, and finally surrendered its status to imperial and vernacular competitors. Fourteen essays trace Persian’s interactions with Bengali, Chinese, Turkic, Punjabi, and other languages to identify the forces that extended “Persographia,” the domain of written Persian. Spanning the ages of expansion and contraction, The Persianate World offers a critical survey of both the supports and constraints of one of history’s key languages of global exchange. “This groundbreaking collection illuminates the multifaceted and very complex history of the rise and decline of the Persian language as a lingua franca.” AHMAD KARIMI-HAKKAK, author of Recasting Persian Poetry “With erudition and refinement, this book accomplishes something remarkable—it provides a timely corrective to an anachronistic understanding of the Persianate sphere as an empire of letters centred on Iran.” PAOLO SARTORI, author of Visions of Justice “An exceptionally important contribution to our understanding of what constituted the Persianate world.” ANDREW PEACOCK, University of St. Andrews NILE GREEN holds the Ibn Khaldun Endowed Chair in World History at the University of California, Los Angeles.

  {"id":"green_2023_introduction","abstract":"In recent decades, the ascent of the “Persianate world” paradigm has prompted a major revival in the study of Persian sources in and on South Asia, while at the same time building on Marshall Hodgson's capacious original conception of the Persianate as being more than Persian\n              per se\n              by including “more local languages of high culture that … depended upon Persian wholly or in part for their prime literary inspiration.” While this has been an extraordinarily productive cycle of scholarship, it has also coincided and perhaps contributed to the longstanding occlusion of South Asia's Arabic tradition.

  {"id":"gresta_2008_saffron","abstract":"Saﬀron (Crocus sativus L.) is an autumnal ﬂowering geophite whose dried stigmas, well known for their aromatic and colouring power, have been used since immemorial time as a spice in human nutrition, for medicinal purposes and as a dye. Many doubts remain on its origin; it was probably selected and domesticated in Crete during the Late Bronze Age. Saﬀron is an autotriploid geophyte species, self- and out-sterile and mostly male-sterile and therefore unable to produce seed, that reproduces by means of corms. Furthermore, it has a reverse biological cycle compared with the majority of cultivated and spontaneous plants: ﬂowering ﬁrst in October-November, then vegetative development until May, which means that the vegetative development is not directly important for production of stigmas, but for the production of new corms. Due to its unique biological, physiological and agronomic traits, saﬀron is able to exploit marginal land and to be included in low-input cropping systems, representing an alternative viable crop for sustainable agriculture. Notwithstanding this great potential and the considerable increase in new generation consumer demand for saﬀron, the future of the plant is still uncertain. Indeed, the main obstacles to saﬀron production are: (1) the limited areas of cultivation in countries where it is traditionally grown, (2) the great amount of sophisticated spice, (3) management techniques executed by hand, and (4) the very high price of the spice. Here we review the main biological, genetic and ecological traits associated with agronomic management techniques of saﬀron in relation to environmental conditions. Colour, taste and aroma are the essential features on which the quality of saﬀron stigmas is founded. In turn, these aspects are strictly connected with the biomolecular composition of the stigmas, namely, the carotenoids and their derivatives. With this in mind, the biosynthetic pathway that leads to the formation of saﬀron secondary metabolites and their abundance in the spice is presented, together with the biomedical properties commonly associated with saﬀron. Furthermore, a detailed overview of the more recent instrumental methods to assess the quality of saﬀron, strictly from a chemical point of view, will be discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gresta","given":"F."},{"family":"Lombardo","given":"G.

Furthermore, animal studies have demonstrated strong hypoglycemic properties. However, there are only very few well-controlled clinical studies, a fact that limits the conclusions that can be made about the potential health benefits of cinnamon for free-living humans.

No one has posited an origin for the French term or traced any early history, except to guess that it may come from neo-Latin. Meanwhile there are forms nearly identical to the English word in the trade languages of Southern and Eastern Asia, and ancient Asian languages attest to antecedents for the word's components.

Initially, foreign merchants were concerned only with passing through Southeast Asia on their way to China or India. Southeast Asian coastal centres (entrepôts) facilitated this trade by providing suitable stopping places for sailors and traders; available to them were food, water, and shelter as well as storage facilities and market places for exchange. Soon, however, Southeast Asian merchants began to supplement demand for Eastern and Western products by substituting the products of the jungles of the Indonesian archipelago for those from other sources, and then built upon this initial incursion to market other indigenous forest products. Foreign demand for Southeast Asian products reached a peak when spices from Indonesia's eastern archipelago began to flow out of the Java Sea region to the international ports in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Hall","given":"Kenneth R."}],"citation-key":"hall_1982_indianization","container-title":"Journal of Southeast Asian Studies","container-title-short":"Journal of Southeast Asian Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0022463400014004","ISSN":"0022-4634, 1474-0680","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1982",3]]},"language":"en","page":"81-106","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The “Indianization” of Funan: An Economic History of Southeast Asia's First State","title-short":"The “Indianization” of Funan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0022463400014004/type/journal_article","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"hamdi_2017_number","abstract":"Number and gender are two of the core grammatical categories in Arabic. The assignment of number and gender to foreign words is an area of conflict between MSA and other Arabic varieties. This paper investigates the factors that stand behind the seemingly irregularity of number and gender assignment in Arabic. It appears that speakers follow a form standardized by MSA or enforce another form following their dialects and community conventions. This variation in number and gender assignment to loans gives rise to multiple competing forms that may not be recognized by MSA or some other varieties of Arabic. Yet, the findings demonstrate consistency in assigning number and gender to loans by applying native patterns motivated by frequency of use and the semantics of the referents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Hamdi","given":"Sami"}],"citation-key":"hamdi_2017_number","container-title":"International Journal of Linguistics","container-title-short":"IJL","DOI":"10.5296/ijl.v9i1.10870","ISSN":"1948-5425","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,28]]},"language":"en","page":"79","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Number and Gender Assignment to loanwords in Arabic: Implications from Varieties","title-short":"Number and Gender Assignment to loanwords in Arabic","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/ijl/article/view/10870","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"hamilton_2021_islands","abstract":"Islands are not just geographical units or physical facts; their importance and significance arise from the human activities associated with them. The maritime routes of sailing ships, victualling requirements of their sailors, and strategic demands of seaborne empires in the age of sail – as well as their intrinsic value as sources of rare commodities – meant that islands across the globe played prominent parts in imperial consolidation and expansion. This volume examines the ways in which islands (and groups of islands) contributed to the establishment, extension, and maintenance of the British Empire in the age of sail. Chapters explore the geographical, topographical, economic, and social diversity of the islands that comprised a large component of the British Empire in an era of rapid and significant expansion. Although many were isolated rocky outcrops, they acted as crucial nodal points, providing critical assistance for ships and men embarked on the long-distance voyages that characterized British overseas activities in the period. Intercontinental maritime trade, colonial settlement, and scientific exploration would have been impossible without these oceanic islands. They also acted as sites of strategic competition, contestation, and conflict for rival European powers keen to outstrip each other in developing and maintaining overseas markets, plantations, and settlements. The importance of islands outstripped their physical size, populations, or individual economic contribution to the imperial balance sheet. Standing at the centre of maritime routes of global connectivity, islands offer historians fresh perspectives on the intercontinental communication, commercial connections, and territorial expansion that characterized the British Empire.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,27]]},"citation-key":"hamilton_2021_islands","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780198847229.001.0001","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Hamilton","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"McAleer","given":"John"}],"ISBN":"978-0-19-884722-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,17]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Islands and the British Empire in the Age of Sail","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/39304"},

  {"id":"hansen_2020_year","abstract":"\"In history, myth often abides. It was long assumed that the centuries immediately prior to AD 1000 were lacking in any major cultural developments or geopolitical encounters, that the Europeans hadn't yet discovered North America, that the farthest anyone had traveled over sea was the Vikings' invasion of Britain. But how, then, to explain the presence of blonde-haired people in Mayan temple murals in Chichen Itza, Mexico? Could it be possible that the Vikings had found their way to the Americas during the height of the Mayan empire? Valerie Hansen, a much-honored historian, argues that the year 1000 was the world's first point of major cultural exchange and exploration. Drawing on nearly thirty years of research on medieval China and global history, she presents a compelling account of first encounters between disparate societies. As people on at least five continents ventured outward, they spread technology, new crops, and religion. These encounters, she shows, made it possible for Christopher Columbus to reach the Americas in 1492, and set the stage for the process of globalization that so dominates the modern era. For readers of Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel and Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens, The Year 1000 is an intellectually daring, provocative account that will make you rethink everything you thought you knew about how the modern world came to be.

  {"id":"harris_2020_going","abstract":"Before the seventeenth century, trade across Eurasia was mostly conducted in short segments along the Silk Route and Indian Ocean. Business was organized in family firms, merchant networks, and state-owned enterprises, and dominated by Chinese, Indian, and Arabic traders. However, around 1600 the first two joint-stock corporations, the English and Dutch East India Companies, were established.<em>Going the Distance</em> tells the story of overland and maritime trade without Europeans, of European Cape Route trade without corporations, and of how new, large-scale, and impersonal organizations arose in Europe to control long-distance trade for more than three centuries. Ron Harris shows that by 1700, the scene and methods for global trade had dramatically changed: Dutch and English merchants shepherded goods directly from China and India to northwestern Europe. To understand this transformation, Harris compares the organizational forms used in four major regions: China, India, the Middle East, and Western Europe. The English and Dutch were the last to leap into Eurasian trade, and they innovated in order to compete. They raised capital from passive investors through impersonal stock markets and their joint-stock corporations deployed more capital, ships, and agents to deliver goods from their origins to consumers. <em>Going the Distance</em> explores the history behind a cornerstone of the modern economy, and how this organizational revolution contributed to the formation of global trade and the creation of the business corporation as a key factor in Europe's economic rise.","author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"R.

  {"id":"harris_2021_linguistics","abstract":"Abstract\n            This book centers on a key rupture in the field of linguistics as a hegemony by the theories of Noam Chomsky appeared to be taking hold, a rupture in the 1960s that began a flowering of alternate approaches to Chomsky's framework, but also reoriented his framework markedly. The rupture was between Generative Semantics, which pushed to include more and more meaning in linguistic theory, and Interpretive Semantics, which resisted that push, putting more and more weight on syntactic structure. But in many ways the dispute can be reduced to George Lakoff, the most prominent voice on the more-meaning side, and Chomsky on the more-syntax side. Chomsky is a big personality, quiet and understated but always gesturing at monumental, revolutionary implications for his ideas, and always bringing great numbers of linguists along with him whenever he chases after those implications, stirring up psychology, philosophy, computer science, and other fields in the bargain. Lakoff is also big personality, anything but quiet or understated, equally comfortable gesturing at grand revolutions, equally happy to stir things up. They drive the story, but the story is about theories, data, and various technical developments, set among social currents that range from military industrial politics to the counterculture. All of these factors show up in the book, with a cast of other remarkable and influential characters. Noam Chomsky is unquestionably the most influential linguist of the twentieth century—many people claim of any century—whose work and personal imprint remains powerfully relevant today, so the book culminates with an analysis of Chomsky’s influence and legacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Randy Allen"}],"citation-key":"harris_2021_linguistics","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780199740338.001.0001","edition":"2","ISBN":"978-0-19-974033-8 978-0-19-760866-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,11]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University PressNew York","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The linguistics wars: Chomsky, Lakoff, and the Battle over deep structure","title-short":"The Linguistics Wars","type":"book","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/book/39137"},

  {"id":"haushofer_2023_wonder","abstract":"Between 1850 and 1950, experts and entrepreneurs in Britain and the United States forged new connections between the nutrition sciences and the commercial realm through their enthusiasm for new edible consumables. The resulting food products promised wondrous solutions for what seemed both individual and social ills. By examining products like Gail Borden's meat biscuit, Benger's Food, Kellogg's health foods, Fleischmann's yeast, and food yeast, Wonder Foods shows how new products dazzled with visions of modernity, efficiency, and scientific progress even as they perpetuated exclusionary views about who deserved to eat, thrive, and live. Drawing on extensive archival research, historian Lisa Haushofer reveals that the story of modern food and nutrition was not about innocuous technological advances or superior scientific insights but rather the powerful logic of exploitation and economization that undergirded colonial and industrial food projects. In the process, these wonder food products have shaped both modern food regimes and how we think about food.","author":[{"family":"Haushofer","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"haushofer_2023_wonder","collection-number":"80","collection-title":"California studies in food and culture","event-place":"Oakland, California","ISBN":"978-0-520-39038-6 978-0-520-39039-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"270","publisher":"University of California Press","publisher-place":"Oakland, California","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Wonder foods: the science and commerce of nutrition","title-short":"Wonder foods","type":"book"},

Problems with clarifying this issue include the often poor quality of Tibetan sources, the confusion of Tibet and Tangut (Xi Xia) in Persian sources, and misunderstanding by modern scholars of Chinese terms relating to Tibet. In fact, Chinese sources make clear that there was considerable contact between the Mongols and Tibet before 1240.

  {"id":"haw_2017_cinnamon","abstract":"Abstract: There is a widespread assumption that ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as the spices now known by those names that is, products obtained from trees of the genus Cinnamomum. This article argues that this is not the case, but that the “cinnamon” and “cassia” of ancient writers very probably came from plants native to northeast Africa, as several early writers actually state. Possible African sources of ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” are suggested. The most probable principal source is identified as Cassia abbreviata. It is also argued that alleged identifications of cinnamon or cassia at archaeological sites in the Mediterranean region are questionable. It is shown that cinnamon and cassia did not figure in Southeast Asian and Chinese trade at an early period, and that Austronesian settlement of Madagascar occurred after the Classical period, probably during the second half of the first millennium CE, too late for Southeast Asians to have played any major role in trade with the Roman Empire. There is no good reason to believe that true cinnamon and cassia were traded to the western Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean region at any very early date. This article truly takes an interdisciplinary approach to its subject: the author is a botanist as well as a historian, and is able to use original Chinese sources. The question of whether ancient “cinnamon” and “cassia” were the same as modern cinnamon and cassia (products of trees of the genus Cinnamomum) is a thorny one, which has been repeatedly debated in the past, usually with no very conclusive result. The most recent thorough discussion of the issue, by Lionel Casson, concluded that the ancient and modern products were the same. This article refutes that view: it is clear that Casson lacked the botanical knowledge necessary to reach a sound conclusion. The article deals with its subject thoroughly, examining archaeological as well as textual evidence, and using a wide range of sources.","author":[{"family":"Haw","given":"Stephen George"}],"citation-key":"haw_2017_cinnamon","container-title":"Journal of Ancient History and Archaeology","DOI":"10.14795/j.v4i1.211","ISSN":"2360-266X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"5-18","publisher":"Mega Publishing House","title":"Cinnamon, Cassia and Ancient Trade","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

  {"id":"hayes_2008_supertasting","abstract":"Polymorphisms in the TAS2R38 gene provide insight to phenotypes long associated 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide bitterness. We tested relationships between TAS2R38 genotype, taste phenotype, and fungiform papillae (FP) number in 139 females and 59 males (age range 21–60 years), primarily of European ancestry. DNA was analyzed for 3 polymorphic sites, identifying common (alanine–valine–isoleucine [AVI/AVI], heterozygotes, proline–alanine–valine [PAV/PAV]) and rare (proline–valine–isoleucine, alanine–alanine–valine, AAI) forms. Individuals with PROP threshold >0.15 mM were almost exclusively AVI/AVI; those with threshold <0.1 mM could have any genotype. PAV/PAVs were more difficult to identify with PROP taste measures, although perceived bitterness of moderate PROP concentrations (0.32, 1 mM) had better correspondence with genotype than did threshold. For AVI/AVIs, increases in bitterness from 1 to 3.2 mM PROP nearly paralleled those of TAS2R38 heterozygotes and PAV/PAVs. Some bitterness gains were related to FP number sampled from a standard area on the tongue tip, yet the PROP bitterness–FP relationship differed across genotype. Among homozygotes, FP was a significant determinant of PROP bitterness; heterozygotes showed a flat relationship. Those tasting concentrated PROP as more bitter also tasted concentrated sucrose, citric acid, sodium chloride, and quinine as more intense, even after statistically controlling for TAS2R38 genotype, FP, and intensity of tones (nonoral standard). To summarize, although PROP threshold generally exhibited single-gene complete dominance, PROP bitterness may involve additional bitter receptors as evidenced by misclassification of some nontaster homozygotes and the bitterness functions for concentrated PROP. Variability in receptor expression may explain attenuated bitterness–FP relationships. PROP bitterness does associate with heightened taste sensations (i.e., supertasting), but this is not due to TAS2R38 polymorphisms.","author":[{"family":"Hayes","given":"John E."},{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."},{"family":"Kidd","given":"Judith R."},{"family":"Duffy","given":"Valerie B."}],"citation-key":"hayes_2008_supertasting","container-title":"Chemical Senses","DOI":"10.1093/chemse/bjm084","ISSN":"0379-864X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"page":"255-265","title":"Supertasting and PROP Bitterness Depends on More Than the TAS2R38 Gene","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjm084","volume":"33"},
  {"id":"haynie_2014_wanderworter","abstract":"Wanderwörter are a problematic set of words in historical linguistics. They usually make up a small proportion of the total vocabulary of individual languages, and only a minority of loanwords. They are, however, found frequently in languages from across the world. There is, to our knowledge, no general synthesis of Wanderwörter patterns, causes of exceptionally high borrowing rates for particular lexical items, or estimates of their frequency across language families. Claims about the causes of their spread exist, but have not been widely tested. Nor, despite researchers’ intuitions that Wanderwörter form a distinct type of borrowing, is there a clear demonstration that Wanderwörter are, in fact, different from other loanwords in any concrete way. In the present paper, we examine the phenomenon of Wanderwörter using a standard sample of vocabulary in languages of Australia, North America and South America. The investigation presented here examines Wanderwörter in great enough detail to answer questions about the linguistic and social processes by which Wanderwörter migrate as well as the shapes and densities of the resulting networks. We show that Wanderwörter can be categorically distinguished from other borrowing. The study of Wanderwörter to date has focused on agricultural or industrialized societies; however, the phenomenon is well attested in networks of smaller languages. There are areal differences in types of Wanderwörter and the networks through which they spread. Specific categories of cultural association, including but not limited to agricultural cultivation, condition widespread borrowing. Wanderwörter are outliers in the realm of loanwords, borrowed far more frequently than typical lexical items but still a subset of a more general phenomenon. We show that the link between Wanderwörter and cultural diffusion may be a more sound basis for defining this term than the traditional definitions that invoke the loan frequency, areality, or untraceability of these terms.","author":[{"family":"Haynie","given":"Hannah"},{"family":"Bowern","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Epps","given":"Patience"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Jane"},{"family":"McConvell","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"haynie_2014_wanderworter","container-title":"Ampersand","container-title-short":"Ampersand","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amper.2014.10.001","ISSN":"2215-0390","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-18","title":"Wanderwörter in languages of the Americas and Australia","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215039014000022","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"heldaasseland_2011_persian","abstract":"From the ﬁrst century BCE until the third century CE, Roman trade with the Indian Ocean passed by way of two major axes: the Red Sea–Nile and the Persian Gulf–Syrian Desert. The overall distance by way of the Persian Gulf–Syrian Desert route was considerably shorter, but the overland part of the journey was almost four times longer, and goods had to pass through politically tense border regions between the Parthian and Roman empires. Although the relative importance of the two routes probably varied, both were in operation at the same time and for a prolonged period. How can this be explained? This article explores the passages from India to the Mediterranean in the Roman imperial period and argues that a relatively straightforward answer is to be found in the annual rhythms of movement responding to ocean winds, desert weather and river ﬂoods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Heldaas Seland","given":"Eivind"}],"citation-key":"heldaasseland_2011_persian","container-title":"World Archaeology","container-title-short":"World Archaeology","DOI":"10.1080/00438243.2011.605844","ISSN":"0043-8243, 1470-1375","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","page":"398-409","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Persian Gulf or the Red Sea?

It highlights the region’s “sea people”, giving special attention to their complex and dynamic interactions with terrestrial communities. Their cultures and aquatic lifestyles, it is argued, are relevant to understanding the wider context of various historical and contemporary issues in this region. Since the emergence of large-scale harbour polities in Sumatra, Borneo and other parts of insular Southeast Asia, nomadic maritime communities have intermittently appropriated the roles of prote´ge´s, outlaws and victims in a multilayered and multifaceted interplay of seaborne navigation, commerce and warfare. On the one hand, many of the interethnic power relations that helped shape the maritime history of Southeast Asia have remained intact to date and can help us understand a number of present-day phenomena. On the other, 19th and 20th-century developments have largely conﬁned these communities to the margins of society, while their erstwhile “maritory” has become the battleground of competing “globalised” crime syndicates, maritime terrorists and post-independent nation states with modern navies.

The work brings together data and approaches from archaeology, historical linguistics and other disciplines, proposing a reconstruction of cultural and linguistic contact between Southeast Asia and its maritime neighbours to the west in order to advance our historical understanding of this part of the world. Numerous biological, commercial, and technical items are examined. The study underlines that the analysis of lexical data is one of the strongest tools to detect and analyse contact between two or more speech communities. It demonstrates how Southeast Asian products and concepts were mainly dispersed by speakers of Malay varieties, although other communities played a role as well. Through an interdisciplinary approach, the study offers new perspectives on the role of insular Southeast Asian agents on cultural dynamism and interethnic contact in the pre-modern Indian Ocean World.","author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_2014_phd","container-title":"Wacana Journal of the Humanities of Indonesia","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"377-384","title":"PhD Thesis Summary: Southeast Asia in the ancient Indian Ocean World: Combining historical linguistic and archaeological approaches","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

These authors incorporated ideas from South East Asia as well as China and Europe in their works, providing insights in traditional notions of heteronormative manhood, but also exposing major reconfigurations of gender within the diverse conditions of modernity. Their writings thus provide an underexplored vista into a remarkably diverse society in transition. I will centre on words used in the Malay vernacular to characterize men and male behaviour. This serves as a springboard to explore three interconnected themes surrounding manliness in Sino-Malay publications: violence, sexuality, and modernity.

  {"id":"hoogervorst_2017_urban","abstract":"This study investigates Java’s urban middle classes and their importance in the formation of ‘modern’ lifestyles in Indonesia. They formed the backbone of both the Dutch colonial project and the resultant Indonesian nation-state. By foregrounding lifestyle as the defining factor of middle-class identity, we demonstrate how language and images provide a methodological framework to reconstruct this group’s ambitions and aspirations. Their language, an urban variety of Malay, was key to accessing and, in fact, creating discourses of modernity. This transformation was accelerated by the ‘visual turn’ in the late-colonial Netherlands Indies—and, indeed, globally. Advertisements and other visual messages, typically through the medium of the Malay language, promoted new ways to dress, work, travel, and consume. Yet Java’s middle classes were by no means uncritical recipients of these colonial and global novelties. A counterdiscourse soon emerged, which questioned the consequences of being modern and the dangers of losing traditional values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Schulte Nordholt","given":"Henk"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_2017_urban","container-title":"Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia","DOI":"10.1163/22134379-17304002","ISSN":"0006-2294, 2213-4379","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"442-474","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Urban middle classes in colonial Java (1900–1942): images and language","title-short":"Urban middle classes in colonial java (1900–1942)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/abstract/journals/bki/173/4/article-p442_2.xml","volume":"173"},
  {"id":"hoogervorst_2017_what","abstract":"Did the Chinese in late colonial Java have their own variety of Malay? The books, newspapers and periodicals issued by Chinese-owned publishing houses indeed feature an idiosyncratic linguistic style. It is less clear how this variety differed from the Malay of other ethnic groups. This has led to the belief that ‘Chinese Malay’ was a purely political concept detached from linguistic reality. Taking issue with this assumption, I call attention to four sociolinguistic phenomena in the Netherlands Indies that have been labelled as ‘Chinese Malay’: (1) mixed languages consisting of elements from local Malay, Javanese and Hokkien; (2) a Chinese-influenced idiom seen in translated books; (3) code-mixing with Hokkien as a deliberate tool to inscribe ethnic difference; and (4) the use of stereotyped Chinese accents for humorous purposes. I approach these phenomena as mutually complementary lenses to investigate the linguistic character of the Chinese-authored Malay publications that shaped the literary landscapes of late colonial Java. Doing so provides novel insights into the society in which they were produced, especially in the under-explored domains of inter-ethnic contact, popular literature, cultural identification, and humour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom G."}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_2017_what","container-title":"Indonesia and the Malay World","container-title-short":"Indonesia and the Malay World","DOI":"10.1080/13639811.2017.1340030","ISSN":"1363-9811, 1469-8382","issue":"133","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,2]]},"language":"en","page":"294-314","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"What kind of language was ‘Chinese Malay’ in late colonial Java?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13639811.2017.1340030","volume":"45"},
  {"id":"hoogervorst_2018_sailors","abstract":"A renewed interested in Indian Ocean studies has underlined possibilities of the transnational. This study highlights lexical borrowing as an analytical tool to deepen our understanding of cultural exchanges between Indian Ocean ports during the long nineteenth century, comparing loanwords from several Asian and African languages and demonstrating how doing so can re-establish severed links between communities. In this comparative analysis, four research avenues come to the fore as speciﬁcally useful to explore the dynamics of non-elite contact in this part of the world: (1) nautical jargon, (2) textile terms, (3) culinary terms, and (4) slang associated with society’s lower strata. These domains give prominence to a spectrum of cultural brokers frequently overlooked in the wider literature. It is demonstrated through concrete examples that an analysis of lexical borrowing can add depth and substance to existing scholarship on interethnic contact in the Indian Ocean, providing methodological inspiration to examine lesser studied connections. This study reveals no uniﬁed linguistic landscape, but several key individual connections between the ports of the Indian Ocean frequented by Persian, Hindustani, and Malay-speaking communities.","author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_2018_sailors","container-title":"Itinerario","container-title-short":"Itinerario","DOI":"10.1017/S0165115318000645","ISSN":"0165-1153","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"516-548","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sailors, Tailors, Cooks, and Crooks: On Loanwords and Neglected Lives in Indian Ocean Ports","title-short":"Sailors, Tailors, Cooks, and Crooks","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0165115318000645/type/journal_article","volume":"42"},

We call attention to three diﬀerent types of cooks documented in the island’s textual record: household cooks (including commercial cooks), cooks in religious establishments, and professional cooks. Women were in charge of the ﬁrst category, whereas the second and third were controlled by men yet also featured women. Household cooks and religious cooks mainly prepared simple fare, whereas chefs employed by courts were responsible for the repast of the elites. To learn more about these cooks and their skills, we examine speciﬁc passages of Old Javanese texts, which should not be neglected by food historians of Southeast Asia. These excerpts are analyzed in comparison with contemporaneous texts from India and Cambodia. We also assess them against more recent culinary practices in insular Southeast Asia, enabling us to reconstruct some of the actual dishes mentioned in the classical literature. Through careful reading between the lines, we thus bring together diﬀerent strands of evidence to revise Java’s culinary history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Jákl","given":"Jiří"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_2020_rise","container-title":"Global Food History","container-title-short":"Global Food History","DOI":"10.1080/20549547.2019.1707017","ISSN":"2054-9547, 2054-9555","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"3-21","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Rise of the Chef in Java","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20549547.2019.1707017","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"hoogervorst_2021_screaming","abstract":"An insensitive poem published in 1935 sparked a wave of outrage among the Indies Chinese students in the Netherlands. Titled The yellow peril, it had started as an inside joke among Leiden’s Indologists, yet quickly aroused the fury of both moderates and radicals. Their anti-colonial activism flared up for months, attracting numerous allies and eventually taking hold in the Netherlands Indies. After the Indologists had apologized, the number of activists willing to push for more structural change dwindled. As such, this microhistory lays bare some broader dynamics of anti-racism. We argue that ethnic Chinese, who continue to be portrayed as an unobtrusive model minority, have a longer legacy of activism than they are usually given credit for. This is particularly relevant in the present, when Covid-induced Sinophobia, anti-Black racism, and a reassessment of the colonial past are inspiring new movements and forging new antiracist solidarities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoogervorst","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Tarisa","given":"Melita"}],"citation-key":"hoogervorst_2021_screaming","container-title":"Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia","container-title-short":"Bijdr. taal-, land- volkenkd.","DOI":"10.1163/22134379-bja10020","ISSN":"0006-2294, 2213-4379","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,3]]},"language":"en","page":"27-61","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘The Screaming Injustice of Colonial Relationships’: Tracing Chinese Anti-racist Activism in the Netherlands","title-short":"‘The Screaming Injustice of Colonial Relationships’","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/bki/177/1/article-p27_2.xml","volume":"177"},

It is built upon the relation-based structure of WordNet. On one hand, a bilingual WordNet is constructed with the crucial design feature of treating bilingual translation correspondences as lexical semantic relations. On the other hand, SUMO (suggested upper merged ontology) is adopted as the shared system of conceptual categorization. SUMO is also one of the first conceptual categorization systems to be mapped to an English lexicon. By the combination of ontology and WordNet, we hope that sinica BOW will 1) give each linguistic form a rigorous conceptual location, 2) clarify the relation between conceptual classification and linguistic instantiation, and 3) facilitate genuine cross-lingual access of knowledge. In addition to the integration of WordNet and ontology, it is also an important goal of sinica BOW to integrate lexical resources such that the linguistic-to-conceptual representation and language -to- language gaps can be bridged simultaneously.

  {"id":"huang_2010_sinica","abstract":"The Academia Sinica Bilingual Ontological Wordnet (Sinica BOW) integrates three resources: WordNet, English-Chinese Translation Equivalents Database (ECTED), and SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology). The three resources were originally linked in two pairs: WordNet 1.6 was manually mapped to SUMO (Niles & Pease 2003) and also to ECTED (the English lemmas in WordNet were mapped to their Chinese lexical equivalents). ECTED encodes both equivalent pairs and their semantic relations (Huang et al. 2003). With the integration of these three key resources, Sinica BOW functions both as an English-Chinese bilingual wordnet and a bilingual lexical access to SUMO. Sinica BOW allows versatile access and facilitates a combination of lexical, semantic, and ontological information. Versatility is built in with its bilinguality, and the lemma-based merging of multiple resources. First, either English or Chinese can be used for the query, as well as for presenting the content of the resources. Second, the user can easily access the logical structure of both the WordNet and SUMO ontology using either words or conceptual nodes. Third, multiple linguistic indexing is built in to allow additional versatility. Fourth, domain information allows another dimension of knowledge manipulation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Ru-Yng"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Hsiang-bin"}],"citation-key":"huang_2010_sinica","container-title":"Ontology and the Lexicon","DOI":"10.1017/CBO9780511676536.012","edition":"1","editor":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-ren"},{"family":"Calzolari","given":"Nicoletta"},{"family":"Gangemi","given":"Aldo"},{"family":"Lenci","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Oltramari","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Prevot","given":"Laurent"}],"ISBN":"978-0-521-88659-8 978-0-511-67653-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"201-211","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sinica BOW (Bilingual Ontological WordNet): integration of bilingual WordNet and SUMO","title-short":"Sinica BOW (Bilingual Ontological WordNet)","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/CBO9780511676536A087/type/book_part"},

He was born in Malaga, Spain, and died in Damascus, Syria. He is considered one of the major scientists of Muslim Spain. His father was a veterinarian, which earned him the nickname al-Baitar, Arabic for veterinarian. Ibn al-Baitar was also trained by a pioneering Andalusian botanist called Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati.

  {"id":"ibnsina_1329_alqanun","abstract":"Avicenna, 980-1037 Author. \nAbu ʻAli al-Husayn Ibn Sina was born in Bukhara (present-day Uzbekistan) in 980 and died in Hamadan (present-day Iran) in 1037. One of the intellectual luminaries of the medieval world, known in the Latin West as Avicenna, this Persian polymath was often referred to by Muslim authors as al-Shaykh al-Raʼīs (the preeminent scholar), acknowledgment of his status as one of the foremost savants of the Islamic world. A prolific author, Ibn Sina wrote on topics as varied as metaphysics, theology, medicine, psychology, earth sciences, physics, astronomy, astrology, and chemistry. Ibn Sina's fame in Europe rests principally on this work, al-Qānūn fī al-ṭibb (The canon of medicine), which was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona in the 12th century and remained part of the standard curriculum for medical students until the late 17th century. It was due to the reputation of this work, as well as two of Ibn Sina's other works that were translated into Latin-al-Adwiya al-qalbīya (Cardiac medication) and al-Urjūza fī al-ṭibb (a versified manual on medicine)-that Ibn Sina was sometimes referred to in the Latin West as princeps medicorum (prince of physicians). The Canon of Medicine is organized into five books as follows: Book 1 is entitled al-Umūr al-kulliya fī 'ilm al-ṭibb (General medical principles) and covers the basic principles of medicine; Book 2 is entitled al-Adwiya al-mufrada (Materia medica) and lists approximately 800 individual drugs of vegetable and mineral origin; Book 3 is entitled al-Amrāḍ al-juz'iya (Special pathology) and discusses the diseases of individual organs; Book 4 is entitled al-Amrāḍ allatī lā takhtaṣṣ bi 'udw bi 'aynihi (Diseases involving more than one member) and discusses medical conditions that affect the entire body, such as fevers and poisons; Book 5 is entitled al-Adwiya al-murakkaba wa al-aqrābādhīn (Formulary) and lists some 650 medicinal compounds as well as their uses and effects. The present manuscript includes Book 1. Also present are fragments from Book 2, which appears to have sustained heavy water damage. Some of the preserved details in this part of the work include the beautiful illuminated title panel marking the beginning of the second book, which appears on page 298. There are occasional marginal additions, corrections, and glosses. The text is in black naskh script, with headings in red. The manuscript was completed in 729 AH (1329).\n\n    -  Title devised, in English, by Library staff. \n    -  Original resource extent: 314 folios ; 250 x 195 millimeters. \n    -  Reference extracted from World Digital Library: A.Z.

Recent studies have shown new promising antiviral sesquiterpene coumarins from this old phytomedicine. The present review summarizes the information concerning the traditional uses, phytochemistry and biological activities of asafoetida.","author":[{"family":"Iranshahy","given":"Milad"},{"family":"Iranshahi","given":"Mehrdad"}],"citation-key":"iranshahy_2011_traditional","container-title":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","container-title-short":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","DOI":"10.1016/j.jep.2010.11.067","ISSN":"03788741","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"1-10","source":"Zotero","title":"Traditional uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of asafoetida (Ferula assa-foetida oleo-gum-resin)—A review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378874110008524","volume":"134"},

In this powerful and complex empire, the production and consumption of food reflected the lives of people from sultans to soldiers. Food bound people of different classes and background together, defining identity and serving symbolic functions in the social, religious, political and military spheres. Bountiful Empire: A History of Ottoman Cuisine examines the foodways of the Ottoman Empire as they changed and evolved over more than five centuries. The book starts with an overview of the earlier culinary traditions in which Ottoman cuisine was rooted, such as those of the Central Asian Turks, Abbasids, Seljuks and Byzantines, and goes on to focus on diverse aspects of this rich culinary culture, including etiquette, cooks, restaurants, military food, food laws and food trade. This meticulously researched account draws on more than six hundred primary and secondary sources, ranging from archive documents to poetry, and includes over one hundred illustrations. It is a fresh and lively insight into an empire that until recent decades has been sidelined or viewed through orientalist spectacles.

First, pronounced erotic symbolism of nuts, pervasive in poems, is discussed. In what is clearly a literary cliche, nuts, especially a variety called in the texts “dwarf/ivory nuts” are likened to a woman’s breasts. Second, the coconut palm is represented as a plant element typical of the seashore environment, its natural habitat, as well as of remote, oten small, villages in the Javanese interior. It is argued that this image relects the fact that the coconut palm, propagated sexually, cannot travel inland without the human agency, and that harvesting of the coconut palms may have been an important, if not dominant, element of remote inland settlements that relied on the palm economy rather than on rice cultivation. It gives us an interesting glimpse into in “imagined” ancient Java, where palm economy may have represented a backbone of local economy. hird, this digniied status of the coconut palm, all but forgotten now, is further emphasized in a couple of literary images where the palm is represented as one of the divine, “celestial” trees, growing in heavenly gardens.","author":[{"family":"Jákl","given":"Jiří"}],"citation-key":"jakl__literary","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Literary representations of the coconut palm in Old Javanese kakavin poetry","type":"article-journal"},

First, a proverbial symbiosis of the sugar palm and a variety of a toxic liana are analyzed and explained. Second, it is argued that the sugar palm was perceived in ancient Java as the abode of celestial nymphs, and has been endowed with strong erotic connotations. hird, complex and oten problematic relationship between the sugar palm/celestial nymphs and ascetics/ hermits is explored. It is argued that a combination of biological and cultural inhibitions resulted in the fact that the sugar palm in Old Javanese literature is never represented as growing at the precincts of hermitages and other religious establishments. Next, the role of the symbolism of the sugar palm in the pre-modern concept of bravery is explored.

Typically, scholars of Javanese literature suppose that ləpihan denotes predominantly, if not exclusively, processed palm leaves, used for letters, messages, and books. A close reading of Old and Middle Javanese texts, however, suggests that the description of ləpihan is not consistent with the physical properties of the palm-leaf book. The essay offers an alternative hypothesis that Old Javanese ləpihan denoted folding books, blank note-books, and documents such as letters made from processed “bark paper,” a material well-known and used in pre-Islamic Java. This format was also known in the pre-Islamic period in Sumatra, as testified by the so-called Tanjung Tanah manuscript, a Malay “bark paper” folding book, dated to the late 14th or early 15th century.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jákl","given":"Jiří"}],"citation-key":"jakl_2016_folding","container-title":"Bulletin de l'Ecole française d'Extrême-Orient","container-title-short":"befeo","DOI":"10.3406/befeo.2016.6234","ISSN":"0336-1519","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"165-193","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Folding Book Format (Concertina) in Pre-Islamic Java: Revisiting the Old Javanese Term ləpihan","title-short":"The Folding Book Format (Concertina) in Pre-Islamic Java","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.persee.fr/doc/befeo_0336-1519_2016_num_102_1_6234","volume":"102"},
  {"id":"jakl_2016_iiterary","abstract":"The contribution analyses the literary motif of acquiring trophy heads in the context of warfare practices depicted in kakavin, court poems composed in a literary register of Old Javanese. In the ﬁrst part, two terms of unclear meaning, cәṅәl and varagaṅ, are discussed in detail. It is argued that Old Javanese cәṅәl denotes ‘trophy head’, a severed head rendered as a token of martial prowess. Evidence of the Navanatya, an Old Javanese account of court etiquette composed in the 14th century, is used to support my claim that ﬁctive kakavin do reﬂect the practice of head-taking as part of Javanese pre-Islamic warfare culture. It is demonstrated that the status of head-taking in kakavin is ambiguous. Though typically ascribed to the characters of adharma, the king, a protector of dharma, is represented in a couple of texts as a receiver of trophy heads. In the second and third parts of this article the category of combatants called varagaṅ, associated in Old Javanese texts with predatory warfare and with adharma, is analysed. Fighting as individuals in a loosely dispersed swarm, the main objective of the strategy of varagaṅ was to harass enemy settlements, take captives, and spread terror. It is argued that the category of varagaṅ represented young men who had to prove themselves in battle and whose major objective was to display martial prowess in front of other warriors in one-toone skirmishing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jákl","given":"Jiří"}],"citation-key":"jakl_2016_iiterary","container-title":"Indonesia and the Malay World","container-title-short":"Indonesia and the Malay World","DOI":"10.1080/13639811.2015.1133140","ISSN":"1363-9811, 1469-8382","issue":"129","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",5,3]]},"language":"en","page":"165-187","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Iiterary motif of head-taking in Old Javanese court poems ( <i>kakavin</i> ): cěṅěl and varagaṅ terms revisited","title-short":"The Iiterary motif of head-taking in Old Javanese court poems ( <i>kakavin</i> )","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13639811.2015.1133140","volume":"44"},

With access to previously closed Stanley family archives, Jeal reveals the extent to which Stanley's career and life have been misunderstood and undervalued. Few have started life as disadvantaged as Stanley. Rejected by both parents and consigned to a Welsh workhouse, he emigrated to America as a penniless eighteen-year-old. Jeal re-creates Stanley's rise to success, his friendships and romantic relationships, and his life-changing decision to assume an American identity. Stanley's epic but unfairly forgotten African journeys are described, establishing the explorer as the greatest to set foot on the continent.--From publisher description","author":[{"family":"Jeal","given":"Tim"}],"citation-key":"jeal_2007_stanley","event-place":"New Haven, CT","ISBN":"978-0-300-12625-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 154689070","publisher":"Yale University Press","publisher-place":"New Haven, CT","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Stanley: The impossible life of Africa's greatest explorer","title-short":"Stanley","type":"book"},

Thirteen chapters evoke the joy and discovery of reading a menu dotted with the sharp-eyed annotations of a linguist. Jurafsky points out the subtle meanings hidden in filler words like \"rich\" and \"crispy,\" zeroes in on the metaphors and storytelling tropes we rely on in restaurant reviews, and charts a microuniverse of marketing language on the back of a bag of potato chips. The fascinating journey through The Language of Food uncovers a global atlas of culinary influences. With Jurafsky's insight, words like ketchup, macaron, and even salad become living fossils that contain the patterns of early global exploration that predate our modern fusion-filled world. From ancient recipes preserved in Sumerian song lyrics to colonial shipping routes that first connected East and West, Jurafsky paints a vibrant portrait of how our foods developed. A surprising history of culinary exchange - a sharing of ideas and culture as much as ingredients and flavors - lies just beneath the surface of our daily snacks, soups, and suppers.","author":[{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"jurafsky_2014_language","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-393-24083-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher":"W.W.

  {"id":"kaplan_2014_arabists","abstract":"A tight-knit group closely linked by intermarriage as well as class and old school ties, the \"Arabists\" were men and women who spent much of their lives living and working in the Arab world as diplomats, military attaches, intelligence agents, scholar-adventurers, and teachers. As such, the Arabists exerted considerable influence both as career diplomats and as bureaucrats within the State Department from the early nineteenth century to the present. But over time, as this work shows, the group increasingly lost touch with a rapidly changing American society, growing both more insular and headstrong and showing a marked tendency to assert the Arab point of view. Drawing on interviews, memoirs, and other official and private sources, Kaplan reconstructs the 100-year history of the Arabist elite, demonstrating their profound influence on American attitudes toward the Middle East, and tracing their decline as an influx of ethnic and regional specialists has transformed the State Department and challenged the power of the old elite","author":[{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Robert D."}],"citation-key":"kaplan_2014_arabists","event-place":"Place of publication not identified","ISBN":"978-1-4391-0870-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 893117007","publisher":"Free Press","publisher-place":"Place of publication not identified","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Arabists: The romance of an american elite","title-short":"Arabists","type":"book"},
  {"id":"kaplan_2022_adriatic","abstract":"\"In this insightful travelogue, geopolitical expert Robert Kaplan turns his perceptive eye to the Adriatic Sea, a region that has always been a crossroads in trade, culture, and ideas. Kaplan undertakes a journey through Italy and the Balkan countries lining the Adriatic to reveal much more to the region than news stories about resurgent populism or the refugee crisis let on. As he travels, the stark truth emerges that the age of populism is merely an epiphenomenon--a swan song for the age of nationalism itself--and that the future of Europe lies in a different direction entirely as he observes a breaking down of the distinctions between east and west, a return to alignments of an earlier era. Traveling the coastline from Italy to Slovenia and Croatia, to Montenegro to Albania and to Greece, he engages perceptive cultural criticism and an urgent study of Europe as a whole, seen through the lens of these countries. He finds clues to what the future may hold in history as he reflects on contemporary issues like the refugee crisis, the return of populist nationalism, battles over the control of fossil fuel resources, and how the Adriatic will once again be a global trading hub as it is set to be connected to China's Belt and Road initiative. With a cross-pollination of history, literature, art, architecture, and current events along with a map and photographs throughout, Kaplan demonstrates how Europe is distilled within the geography of the Adriatic, an often-overlooked region rich with answers and insights about the fate of the continent\"--","author":[{"family":"Kaplan","given":"Robert D."}],"call-number":"D971","citation-key":"kaplan_2022_adriatic","edition":"First edition","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-399-59106-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Random House","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Adriatic: A concert of civilizations at the end of the modern age","title-short":"Adriatic","type":"book"},

  {"id":"karrer_1991_capsaicin","abstract":"The desensitization resulting from application of 10 or 100 ppm capsaicin was investigated, using daily testing of a capsaicin series (1–1000 ppm, in log steps). The series showed a significant decrement in perceived burn following desensitization with either concentration. Perceived burn of 100 and 1000 ppm did not recover from 100 ppm desensitization in six days, and perceived burn of 1–1000 ppm did not recover from 10 ppm desensitization in six days. When single capsaicin concentrations, rather than the series, were tested at one, two, four, or six days after desensitization, 10 ppm recovered from 10 ppm desensitization in one or two days, and 100 ppm recovered from 100 ppm desensitization between two and four days. This suggests that daily testing with the capsaicin series delayed recovery from desensitization. Nontasters of 6-n-propylthiouracil rated capsaicin burn lower than did tasters. The application method of rolling capsaicin onto the tongue with a swab was found to transiently inhibit brrn.

  {"id":"kartika__spice","abstract":"Long ago, before colonial period, Jakarta was known as Bandar City. The Sunda Kelapa port became a trading center as well as economic center in the archipelago. Many traders from Java, Bugis, Malay, Arab, European, and Chinese came to trade to Bandar City through the Sunda Kelapa Harbor. Spices became one of the trading commodities at that time apart from cloth, porcelain, coffee, perfumes, pepper, gold, fruits, and so on. Batavian cuisine at that time was already formed and the got the influence of cultural acculturation that occurred between the Batavians and other ethnic groups in Bandar City or Batavia. The influence of foreign ethnic groups affected the ingredient and cooking techniques of Batavian culinary treasures. These can be called as spice routes from other ethnic groups to the Batavian culinary trail. Therefore, Batavia is as a native of Jakarta, has a rich and diverse culture, especially in the field of culinary gastronomy, has inherited many cultural values and local wisdom in every typical Batavian culinary menu. Gastronomy and culture have a very close relationship, so that every Batavia cuisine and food has its own philosophy that grows and develops in aspects of life. The relationship between culture and gastronomy arises because of the results of cultivation in the agricultural sector so that the embodiment of color, aroma and taste of a food can be traced to its origin from the environment where the raw material is produced. This review collects the information and data through observation, in depth interview, and literature study. Interview conducted to the informants who were Batavia historians and elders, cooks and native Batavian who were scattered in the neighbourhood area of Ampera Raya, and Sawangan. In addition, information and data were collected through literature studies and analyzed the culture or philosophy contained in typical Batavia foods or traditional foods. There are 4 stages in this, namely the historical, cultural, geographic, and cooking stages. All of them are closely related to the background of a philosophy that plays a role in the life of the native Batavian which forms the identity of a region as a distinctive value or cultural characteristic. These two things must be maintained by the future generations of the Batavian, so that the values of local wisdom can continue to be preserved and carried out by the indigenous Batavian themselves in Jakarta land..","author":[{"family":"Kartika","given":"Dwi Indah"},{"family":"Kartika","given":"Yunita"}],"citation-key":"kartika__spice","container-title":"Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research","page":"722-733","title":"The Spice Route from Arabic, Europe and China to Jayakarta toward Batavian Cuisine: Revitalization of Batavian Local Wisdom Values through Batavian Culinary Gastronomy","type":"article-journal","volume":"660"},

  {"id":"kaufman_2007_history","abstract":"The word *kakaw(a) (‘cacao’, Theobroma cacao) was widely diffused among Mesoamerican languages, and from there to much of lower Central America. This study provides evidence establishing beyond reasonable doubt that this word originated in the Mije-Sokean family; that it spread from the Mije-Sokean languages in or around the Olmec heartland into southeastern Mesoamerican languages; that its diffusion into Mayan languages took place between about 200 B.C. and A.D. 400; and that it spread from a Mije-Sokean language in or near the Basin of Mexico into languages in the region. It shows that each of the arguments presented by Dakin and Wichmann (2000) against a Mije-Sokean origin is either unworkable, is based upon false premises, or is not relevant; and that their proposed alternative – that it originated in and spread from Nawa into other Mesoamerican languages – conﬂicts with the mass of evidence relevant to the issue. This study also discusses the linguistic details of vocabulary for drinks made from cacao; shows that no proposed etymology for the word chocolate is correct, but agrees with Dakin and Wichmann that its proximate source is a Nawa form chikola:tl; and discusses the history of words for Theobroma bicolor (‘Nicaragua chocolate tree; pataxte’) and their use. The linguistic data are pertinent to issues of intergroup interaction in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, but do not shed light on the nature or the cultural context of the diffusion of cacao in Mesoamerica, nor on its uses.","author":[{"family":"Kaufman","given":"Terrence"},{"family":"Justeson","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"kaufman_2007_history","container-title":"Ancient Mesoamerica","container-title-short":"Ancient Mesoam","DOI":"10.1017/s0956536107000211","ISSN":"0956-5361","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"language":"en","page":"193-237","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The History of the Word for Cacao in Ancient Mesoamerica","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0956536107000211/type/journal_article","volume":"18"},

We present a transdisciplinary case study that combines archeological, historical, and paleoclimate datasets to explore the dynamic, shifting relationships among climate change, civil conflict, and political collapse at Mayapan, the largest Postclassic Maya capital of the Yucatán Peninsula in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries CE. Multiple data sources indicate that civil conflict increased significantly and generalized linear modeling correlates strife in the city with drought conditions between 1400 and 1450 cal. CE.

After four years of growing plants under glass in his London home, Ward created traveling glazed cases that he hoped would be able to transport plants around the world. After a test run from London to Sydney, Ward was proven correct and the Wardian case was born. It is easy to forget in our technologically advanced and globalized world, but prior to the invention of the case it was extremely difficult to transfer plants around the globe, as they often died from mishandling, cold weather, or salt from the ocean. In this enthralling book, Luke Keogh takes us around the world and through history with the Wardian case. He shows that this revolution in the movement of plants transformed the world, impacting the commercial nursery trade, late nineteenth century imperialism, and the global environment.

This research presents and is performed on a complete dataset collection of Southeast Asian palm leaf manuscripts. It contains three different scripts: Khmer script from Cambodia, and Balinese script and Sundanese script from Indonesia. The binarization task is evaluated on many methods up to the latest in some binarization competitions. The seam carving method is evaluated for the text line segmentation task, compared to a recently new text line segmentation method for palm leaf manuscripts. For the isolated character/glyph recognition task, the evaluation is reported from the handcrafted feature extraction method, the neural network with unsupervised learning feature, and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based method. Finally, the Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (RNN-LSTM) based method is used to analyze the word recognition and transliteration task for the palm leaf manuscripts. The results from all experiments provide the latest ﬁndings and a quantitative benchmark for palm leaf manuscripts analysis for researchers in the DIA community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kesiman","given":"Made"},{"family":"Valy","given":"Dona"},{"family":"Burie","given":"Jean-Christophe"},{"family":"Paulus","given":"Erick"},{"family":"Suryani","given":"Mira"},{"family":"Hadi","given":"Setiawan"},{"family":"Verleysen","given":"Michel"},{"family":"Chhun","given":"Sophea"},{"family":"Ogier","given":"Jean-Marc"}],"citation-key":"kesiman_2018_benchmarking","container-title":"Journal of Imaging","container-title-short":"J.

Through the lens of culinary words, this book demonstrates that foreign-origin and hybrid words, previously considered marginal, have become a main source of new imports into our daily lexicon. With case studies from Japan to Mongolia, Hong Kong to Korea, China to Vietnam, and beyond, this book examines how more and more words are becoming borderless and forming their own new global identities. By showcasing some lesser-known regional cuisines, alongside staple dishes that many of us already know and love, this book offers a wide range of examples in order to illustrate the metamorphosis of the manner in which we engage with food words.

With \"culinary nationalism\" defined as a process in flux, diametrically opposed to the limited concept of national cuisine, the contributors call for explicit critical comparisons of cases of culinary nationalism within regions, in order to recognize regional patterns of modern culinary development. In essence, the formation of modern cuisine is revealed to be a process that takes place around the world, in different forms and periods, and is not exclusive to current Eurocentric models. Instead, the essays set out a fresh agenda for thinking about future food studies scholarship through the comparative consideration of key themes: gender, cooking and consumption; the cultivation of taste and authority; the reinterpretation of culinary traditions; inter/national cuisines; hunger, violence, nation; and Asia as culinary imaginary. With 14 original contributions from a range of established food studies scholars, including Katarzyna Cwiertka, Eric Rath, James Farrer, Jean Duruz and Dan Bender, and a foreword and preface from Krishnendu Ray and James Watson, this volume is a vital contribution to the study of food in Asia. The interdisciplinary, and broadly comparative scope of the chapters range across historical and contemporary culinary geographies of East, South and Southeast Asia, drawing from history, sociology, anthropology, geography, economics, literary studies and film and cultural studies\"--","call-number":"GT2853.A78 C85 2019","citation-key":"king_2019_culinary","editor":[{"family":"King","given":"Michelle Tien"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-350-07867-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Bloomsbury Academic","publisher-place":"London","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Culinary nationalism in Asia","type":"book"},

Excavations at the site were interrupted by civil war in 1984, delaying publication of these results and leading to the underestimation of Mantai’s importance in the development of Early Historic Indian Ocean trade. Renewed excavations in 2009–2010 yielded extensive archaeobotanical remains, which, alongside an improved understanding of the site’s chronology, provide important new insights into the development of local and regional trade routes and direct evidence for early trade in the valuable spices upon which later empires were founded.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Kingwell-Banham","given":"Eleanor"},{"family":"Bohingamuwa","given":"Wijerathne"},{"family":"Perera","given":"Nimal"},{"family":"Adikari","given":"Gamini"},{"family":"Crowther","given":"Alison"},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Dorian Q"},{"family":"Boivin","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"kingwell-banham_2018_spice","container-title":"Antiquity","container-title-short":"Antiquity","DOI":"10.15184/aqy.2018.168","ISSN":"0003-598X, 1745-1744","issue":"366","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"en","page":"1552-1570","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spice and rice: pepper, cloves and everyday cereal foods at the ancient port of Mantai, Sri Lanka","title-short":"Spice and rice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0003598X18001680/type/journal_article","volume":"92"},

  {"id":"klosa-kuckelhaus_2022_dictionaries","abstract":"The digital environment represents a qualitatively new level of service for research work with linguistic information presented in dictionary form. And first of all, this applies to index systems. By dic­ tionary indexing we mean a set of formalized rules and procedures, on the basis of which it is possible to obtain information about certain linguistic facts recorded in the dictionary. These rules are implemented in the form of user interfaces. However, one should take into account the fact that the effectiveness of automatic construction of index schemes for a digital dictionary is possible only in a sufficiently formal­ ized environment. This article describes the method and technology of indexing the Etymological Dictio­ nary of the Ukrainian Language (EDUL). For the language indexing of the dictionary, a special computer instrumental system (VLL – virtual lexicographic laboratory) was developed, and adapted to the struc­ ture of the EDUL and focused on the creation of indexes in automatic mode. The digital implementation of the EDUL made it possible to access the entire corpus of the dictionary text regardless of the time of publication of the corresponding volume and opened up opportunities for various digital interpreta­ tions of etymological information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Klosa-Kückelhaus","given":"Annette"},{"family":"Engelberg","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Möhrs","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Storjohann","given":"Petra"}],"citation-key":"klosa-kuckelhaus_2022_dictionaries","DOI":"10.14618/PHPY-6R66","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Leibniz-Institut für Deutsche Sprache (IDS)","source":"DOI.org (Datacite)","title":"Dictionaries and Society.

It combines theoretical notions with analytical devices and has a multidisciplinary essence: it relies on the latest Cultural Linguistic findings, employing spatial semantics, cognitive linguistics, cognitive psychology and ethnography. The book addresses key questions including: How is nature conceptualized by a folk cultural group? How are emotions and other mental states expressed via nature imagery with respect to metaphors and construal schemas? The author argues that folksongs reflect the Hungarian peasant communities' specific treatment of emotions, captured in an underlying cultural schema 'reservedness.' This schema is grounded in principals of morality and tradition, and governs the various levels of representation. The main topics discussed are related to two core issues: cultural metaphors and cultural sche mas of construal in folksongs. It provides a detailed example, based on over 1000 folksongs, of how a cultural group's cognition can be analyzed and better understood through a representative corpus-based linguistic approach. The research is also pioneering in constructing a comprehensive analysis framework adapted to folk poetry, and offers an example of how cultural conceptualizations can be investigated in various discourse types. Last but not least, the book offers insights into the work of Hungarian linguists and folklorists concerning cultural conceptualizations, which have largely been unavailable in English","author":[{"family":"Kóczy","given":"Judit Baranyiné"}],"call-number":"410","citation-key":"koczy_2018_nature","collection-title":"Cultural Linguistics","DOI":"10.1007/978-981-10-5753-3","edition":"1st ed. 2018","event-place":"Singapore","ISBN":"978-981-10-5753-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Springer Singapore : Imprint: Springer","publisher-place":"Singapore","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Nature, metaphor, culture: Cultural conceptualizations in Hungarian folksongs","title-short":"Nature, metaphor, culture","type":"book"},

Prange had consulted the English translation of a Malayalam text by John Wye, that the former had assumed to be lost. However its original palm-leaf manuscript (ōla) is kept at the British Library. This ōla, entitled Kēraḷa Varttamānam, brings to light some remarkable omissions and a few discrepancies in Wye’s translation. Closely reading different manuscripts in Malayalam, Arabic, and English I argue that this ōla is in fact a translation of a sixteenth-century Arabic text, Tuḥfat al-mujāhidīn, well known among scholars of its place and period. Taking it a step ahead, I argue that the very existence of this text points towards the cross-cultural and cross-linguistic interactions between the Arabic and Malayalam spheres of premodern Malabar. The ōla demonstrates one of the ﬁrst instances of Malayalam literature’s engagement with a secular and historical theme as the arrival of the Portuguese.

The author describes the conceptual and formal tools required for building semantic systems capable of understanding text, both for specific tasks such as information extraction and question answering and for broad undertakings such as the Semantic Web. The goal here is to present the fundamental ideas that working systems rest on, and this book is aimed primarily at Computer Science or Engineering students interested in developing semantic systems.

  {"id":"kumar_2008_state","abstract":"Saffron (Crocus sativus L.) is the most expensive spice of the world, and it is one of the 85 members of the genus Crocus. It is native of Asia Minor, and it is cultivated in Mediterranean countries. Saffron predominantly contains certain chemical constituents that are responsible for imparting colour, flavour, and aroma. Some of its components have cytotoxic, anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor properties. Since, saffron is a triploid (2n = 3x = 24) plant and fails to produce seed upon selfing or crossing, so it is propagated through corms. The growing area for saffron is not extensive, although its demand in the international market is increasing. Research activities have been initiated to develop new production technologies of this spice in many countries. Saffron grows best in friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay calcareous soils. Besides, climate and soil, planting time, seed/corm rate, planting depth, corm size/weight, crop density, nutrient management, weed management, growth regulators, harvest, and post-harvest management also influence saffron quality and quantity. In this paper, an attempt has been made to compile the recent agronomic research on saffron for commercial flower and corm production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumar","given":"Rakesh"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Virendra"},{"family":"Devi","given":"Kiran"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Madhu"},{"family":"Singh","given":"M.K."},{"family":"Ahuja","given":"P.S."}],"citation-key":"kumar_2008_state","container-title":"Food Reviews International","container-title-short":"Food Reviews International","DOI":"10.1080/87559120802458503","ISSN":"8755-9129, 1525-6103","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12,22]]},"language":"en","page":"44-85","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"State of Art of Saffron (Crocus sativus L.)

  {"id":"kuzuoglu_2023_codes","abstract":"\"Codes of Modernity explores the global history of Chinese script reforms-the effort to alphabetize and/or simplify the writing system-from the 1890s to the 1980s. During this era, Chinese intellectuals attacked the extant writing system as the main culprit for backwardness and invented dozens of new scripts for Chinese languages. Whereas previous scholarship has examined this subject as an extension of nationalist language reforms, this book argues that Chinese script reforms were at the forefront of an emergent information age. Precipitated by telegraphic networks, printing technologies, and industrial, educational, and bureaucratic exigencies for information management, new scripts were reckoned as the primary medium to increase labor efficiency and engineer alternate political futures in China. This information age was truly global in nature, and the book moves beyond the West/China dichotomy to understand its genuine impact. It situates Chinese script reforms within a comparative and integrative framework, and in doing so, demonstrates for the first time that Chinese script engineers were in close dialogue with American behavioral psychologists, Soviet revolutionaries, and Central Asian typographers, who were all experimenting with new scripts for similar purposes of informational efficiency. Engaging with a wide range of Chinese, Russian, and Turkic-language sources, Codes of Modernity brings these experiments together to offer an alternative approach to writing modern Chinese history and ultimately to rethink the shared experiences of a global information age\"--","author":[{"family":"Kuzuoglu","given":"Ulug"}],"call-number":"PL1175","citation-key":"kuzuoglu_2023_codes","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-55791-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"number-of-pages":"1","publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Codes of modernity: Chinese scripts in the global information age","title-short":"Codes of modernity","type":"book"},

A major objective was to establish the boundaries and dynamics of this trade and the impact it had on Indonesian textile production. I used the richness of the quantitative data in the account books of the Company to analyse trends, variations, and changing frequencies of more than two hundred types and varieties of textiles. In order to analyze the long term import and distribution trends it was necessary to classify and categorize the more than two hundred textiles into clusters.

  {"id":"lanefox_2020_invention","abstract":"Medicine is one of the great fields of achievement of the Ancient Greeks. Hippocrates is celebrated worldwide as the father of medicine and the Hippocratic Oath is admired throughout the medical profession as a founding statement of ethics and ideals. In the fifth century BC, Greeks even wrote of medicine as a newly discovered craft they had invented. Robin Lane Fox's remarkable book puts their invention of medicine in a wider context, from the epic poems of Homer to the first doctors known to have been active in the Greek world. He examines what we do and do not know about Hippocrates and his Oath and the many writings that survive under his name. He then focuses on seven core texts which give the case histories of named individuals, showing that books 1 and 3 belong far earlier than previously recognised. Their re-dating has important consequences for the medical awareness of the great Greek dramatists and the historians Herodotus and Thucydides. Robin Lane Fox pieces together the doctor's thinking from his terse observations and relates it in a new way to the history of Greek prose and ideas. This original and compelling book opens windows onto many other aspects of the classical world, from women's medicine to street-life, empire, art, sport, sex and even botany.

Using the example of digital storytelling, in which short films are cocreated between a researcher and participant, we examine the possibility of cocreated stories as data in philosophical hermeneutic (PH) health research. The etymological explication of the words “data” and “story” brings the meaning of these words closer together while an exploration of the ontological and epistemological assumptions of PH indicate that cocreated digital stories can be viewed as data in a similar way to traditional verbatim interview transcripts used in other types of qualitative health research. Using digital storytelling as a data generation tool in PH health research may help provide a deeper understanding of health-related phenomena by cultivating understanding through genuine conversation, addressing the challenges of language, and apprehending the immediacy of understanding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lang","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Laing","given":"Catherine"},{"family":"Ewashen","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Moules","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"lang_2020_digital","container-title":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","container-title-short":"International Journal of Qualitative Methods","DOI":"10.1177/1609406920913673","ISSN":"1609-4069, 1609-4069","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"160940692091367","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Digital Stories as Data: An Etymological and Philosophical Exploration of Cocreated Data in Philosophical Hermeneutic Health Research","title-short":"Digital Stories as Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1609406920913673","volume":"19"},

Written by those behind the Visualizing Venice project, this book explores the variety of disciplines and analytical methods generated by technologies such as 3D images and interoperable models, GIS mapping and historical cartography, databases, video animations, and applications for mobile devices and the web. The volume is one of the first collections of essays to integrate the theory and practice of visualization technologies with art, architectural, and urban history. The chapters demonstrate how new methodologies generated by technology can change and inform the way historians think and work, and the potential that such methods have to revolutionize research, teaching, and public-facing communication.

Its methodology, Narrative Categorical Analysis, and its toolkit, NarrCat, were both originally developed by the Hungarian Narrative Psychology Group. NarrCat is for machine-made transformation of sentences in self-narratives into psychologically relevant, statistically processable narrative categories. The main body of this flexible and comprehensive system is formed by Psycho-Thematic modules, such as Agency, Evaluation, Emotion, Cognition, Spatiality, and Temporality. The Relational Modules include Social References, Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), and Negation. Certain elements can be combined into Hypermodules, such as Psychological Perspective and Spatio-Temporal Perspective, which allow for even more complex, higher level exploration of composite psychological processes. Using up-to-date developments of corpus linguistics and Natural Language Processing (NLP), a unique feature of NarrCat is its capacity of SRL. The structure of NarrCat, as well as the empirical results in group identity research, is discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"László","given":"János"},{"family":"Csertő","given":"István"},{"family":"Fülöp","given":"Éva"},{"family":"Ferenczhalmy","given":"Réka"},{"family":"Hargitai","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Lendvai","given":"Piroska"},{"family":"Péley","given":"Bernadette"},{"family":"Pólya","given":"Tibor"},{"family":"Szalai","given":"Katalin"},{"family":"Vincze","given":"Orsolya"},{"family":"Ehmann","given":"Bea"}],"citation-key":"laszlo_2013_narrative","container-title":"SAGE Open","container-title-short":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244013492084","ISSN":"2158-2440, 2158-2440","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"215824401349208","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Narrative Language as an Expression of Individual and Group Identity: The Narrative Categorical Content Analysis","title-short":"Narrative Language as an Expression of Individual and Group Identity","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2158244013492084","volume":"3"},

Researchers focused instead on the so-called Silk Road—the land route across Central Asia. Now, the southern maritime trade route of ancient times is emerging from the shadows. Archaeologists are picking through Southeast Asian swamps, diving off Sri Lankan reefs, and digging on African beaches. They aim to track how plants, animals, trade goods, people, and ideas moved around the ocean from 2000 B.C.E. until 1500 C.E. Already the research is uncovering a lost story of Indian Ocean trade that went far beyond the simple exchange of gems and spices and forged surprisingly modern connections among cultures. The work is shifting researchers' focus from the great empires at either end of the Silk Road—Rome and China—to the vibrant societies in between. Key sites include Khao Sam Kaeo, which is perhaps the oldest city in Southeast Asia; an ancient shipwreck off Sri Lanka; and sites along the East African coast that reveal the origins of the Swahili culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Lawler","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"lawler_2014_sailing","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.344.6191.1440","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6191","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6,27]]},"language":"en","page":"1440-1445","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sailing Sinbad's seas","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.344.6191.1440","volume":"344"},

We hypothesized that bioluminescing fireflies, widely known for their vibrant courtship signals, also advertise their noxiousness to echolocating bats. To test this postulate, we pit naïve big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) against chemically defended fireflies (Photinus pyralis) to examine whether and how these beetles transmit salient warnings to bats. We demonstrate that these nocturnal predators learn to avoid noxious fireflies using either vision or echolocation and that bats learn faster when integrating information from both sensory streams—providing fundamental evidence that multisensory integration increases the efficacy of warning signals in a natural predator-prey system. Our findings add support for a warning signal origin of firefly bioluminescence and suggest that bat predation may have driven evolution of firefly bioluminescence.","author":[{"family":"Leavell","given":"Brian C."},{"family":"Rubin","given":"Juliette J."},{"family":"McClure","given":"Christopher J.

  {"id":"leeuwen_2019_thousand","abstract":"Antoine Galland’s French translation of the Thousand and One Nights appeared in 1704. One year later a pirate edition was printed in The Hague, followed by many others. Galland entertained a lively correspondence on the subject with the Dutch intellectual and statesman Gisbert Cuper (1644-1716). Dutch orientalists privately owned editions of the *Nights* and discreetly collected manuscripts of Arabic fairy tales. In 1719 the Nights were first retranslated into Dutch by the wealthy Amsterdam silk merchant and financier Gilbert de Flines (Amsterdam 1690-London 1739). The Thousand and One Nights and Orientalism in the Dutch Republic, 1700-1800: Antoine Galland, Ghisbert Cuper and Gilbert de Flines explores not only the trail of the French and Dutch editions from the eighteenth century Dutch Republic and the role of the printers and illustrators, but also the mixed sentiments of embarrassment and appreciation, and the overall literary impact of the Nights on a Protestant nation in a century when French cultural influence ruled supreme.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Leeuwen","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Vrolijk","given":"Arnoud"}],"citation-key":"leeuwen_2019_thousand","DOI":"10.5117/9789462988798","ISBN":"978-90-485-4112-6 978-94-6298-879-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Thousand and One Nights and Orientalism in the Dutch Republic, 1700-1800: Antoine Galland, Ghisbert Cuper and Gilbert de Flines","title-short":"The Thousand and One Nights and Orientalism in the Dutch Republic, 1700-1800","type":"book","URL":"https://www.aup.nl/en/book/9789462988798"},

Many researches and publications deal with the ancient incense trade, but only a few focus on this trade during the Islamic period. This paper aims to present the results obtained from a multidisciplinary methodology. To identify the main substances used as incense, medieval Arabic sources such as the Kit&#x101;b al-nab&#x101;t written by Al-Asma&#x2bf;&#x12b; and Ab&#x16b; &#x1e24;an&#x12b;fah al-D&#x12b;nawar&#x12b;, or Ibn al-Bay&#x1e6d;&#x101;r's al-J&#x101;mi li-mufrad&#x101;t al-adwiyyah wa-l-aghdhiyyah are of great interest. These textual sources are compared to modern botanical studies and chemical analyses of the substances found in archaeological contexts. This allows us to map the distribution of these materials in order to establish the main trade routes across the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Peninsula.

By the end of the 16th century, the number of drugs documented had reached close to 1,900. And by the end of the last century, published records of CMM have reached 12,800 drugs. The recorded traditional information includes toxicities, incompatibilities, cautions, precautions and contraindications. Thus, contrary to a general misconception, toxicity data on Chinese herbs exist and are not meager. If consulted properly before embarking on a study of CMM, it will save researchers much time and efforts and the frustration of not obtaining consistent or expected results.

We report findings in relation to flagging (marking of loanwords as being foreign material in a given language) and show that it is (weakly) predicated by frequency-of-use and by semantic category of the loanword (core loans are flagged more than cultural ones), but not by listedness. Alongside this trend, we note that perceptions of writers using the words vary enormously in regard to which loans are integrated and familiar, matching neither listedness nor frequency-of-use patterns. This indicates that in NZE, loanword use remains strongly tied up with socio-political identity and language ideology, rather than rooted in linguistic factors (such as, bilingualism or filling in lexical gaps). •Flagging is not only merely a linguistic reflex.•Flagging is also a sociolinguistic tool that enables speakers to consciously spread new incoming loanwords.•Flagging allows speakers to refresh the use of previously existing (sometimes already listed) loanwords.•Flagging is mediated by speaker perception and speaker attitude.•It is therefore not necessarily an accurate barometer for the degree of acceptance/integration of a given loanword in a RL.•This is of particular importance to language contact scenarios of asymmetrical lexical movement.","author":[{"family":"Levendis","given":"Katharine"},{"family":"Calude","given":"Andreea"}],"citation-key":"levendis_2019_perception","container-title":"Ampersand (Oxford, UK)","DOI":"10.1016/j.amper.2019.100056","ISSN":"2215-0390","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"100056","title":"Perception and flagging of loanwords – A diachronic case-study of Māori loanwords in New Zealand English","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"li_2016_visualizing","abstract":"While neural networks have been successfully applied to many NLP tasks the resulting vector-based models are very difﬁcult to interpret. For example it’s not clear how they achieve compositionality, building sentence meaning from the meanings of words and phrases. In this paper we describe strategies for visualizing compositionality in neural models for NLP, inspired by similar work in computer vision. We ﬁrst plot unit values to visualize compositionality of negation, intensiﬁcation, and concessive clauses, allowing us to see wellknown markedness asymmetries in negation. We then introduce methods for visualizing a unit’s salience, the amount that it contributes to the ﬁnal composed meaning from ﬁrst-order derivatives. Our generalpurpose methods may have wide applications for understanding compositionality and other semantic properties of deep networks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Jiwei"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xinlei"},{"family":"Hovy","given":"Eduard"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"li_2016_visualizing","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,8]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:1506.01066","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Visualizing and Understanding Neural Models in NLP","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01066"},
  {"id":"li_2019_corpusbased","abstract":"Translated restaurant menus facilitate tourism and consumerism, but menu translation remains a peripheral area of professional translation and translation studies. This has economic consequences, because translations that exclude a dish’s ingredients, cooking methods, or cultural associations may deter consumers. This article analyses translated menus featuring Chinese dishes in order to establish the extent to which intersemiotic, image-based approaches are used to complement written translations; the level of consistency with which ingredients and cooking methods are translated; and the frequency of culturally speciﬁc dish names that are challenging to translate. A corpus-based methodology is used to compare 3,000 Chinese dish names and their translations from China, Taiwan and abroad. The data reveals very limited intersemiotic translation in existing menus, inconsistent translations of ingredients and cooking methods, and a high percentage of dishes with culturally speciﬁc names. However, these are often omitted in translation, or lack supplementary information concerning their ingredients. It is proposed that a multimodal translation approach incorporating Jakobson’s tripartite theory can enhance menu translation. Menus featuring Pinyin as an intralingual translation can engage learners of Chinese who use this method; interlingual explicitation clariﬁes a dish’s ingredients, cooking methods and cultural speciﬁcity; and intersemiotic, image-based translation conveys culinary artistry clearly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Saihong"}],"citation-key":"li_2019_corpusbased","container-title":"Perspectives","container-title-short":"Perspectives","DOI":"10.1080/0907676X.2018.1483408","ISSN":"0907-676X, 1747-6623","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,2]]},"language":"en","page":"1-19","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A corpus-based multimodal approach to the translation of restaurant menus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0907676X.2018.1483408","volume":"27"},

  {"id":"li_2020_lexical","abstract":"This article investigates the interplay of lexical competition and socio-historical events through a close examination of the use of gambling and gaming based on large-scale synchronic and diachronic corpora. We first set the background for comparison through a synchronic study of the collocational patterns and grammatical relations of the two words using Sketch Engine. We show that gambling tends to be associated with negatively perceived activities and strong disapproval, whereas gaming tends to collocate with recreational activities, business, and technology. Using Google Books Ngram Viewer, we focus on the drastic diachronic changes in use of the two words, from competition to co-development. Based on corpora trends, we correlate the rise and fall of the two words and the change in their competition relation to particular socio-historical events: gold rushes, sports betting, the popularity of video games, and the gaming industry boom. The classical competition model of near synonyms remained valid until recent socio-economic events introduced additional and unique meanings for both words. The article thus shows that linguistic variations as collective human behavior changes can be leveraged to evidence other collective human behavior changes.","author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Longxing"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Vincent Xian"}],"citation-key":"li_2020_lexical","container-title":"SAGE Open","DOI":"10.1177/2158244020951272","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"2158244020951272","title":"Lexical Competition and Change: A Corpus-Assisted Investigation of Gambling and Gaming in the Past Centuries","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2158244020951272","volume":"10"},

Moreover, we show that corporate culture correlates with business outcomes, including operational efficiency, risk-taking, earnings management, executive compensation design, firm value, and deal making, and that the culture-performance link is more pronounced in bad times.

We examine the SpokenBNC, a corpus of around 11.4 million words of British English conversations and identify behavioural differences between speakers that are labelled for gender and age categories. We explore differences in language use and turn-taking dynamics and identify a range of characteristics that set the categories apart. We ﬁnd that female speakers tend to produce more and slightly longer turns, while turns by male speakers feature a higher type-token ratio and a distinct range of minimal particles such as “eh”, “uh” and “em”. Across age groups, we observe, for instance, that swear words and laughter characterize young speakers’ talk, while old speakers tend to produce more truncated words. We then use the observed characteristics to predict gender and age labels of speakers per conversation and per turn as a classiﬁcation task, showing that non-lexical utterances such as minimal particles that are usually left out of dialog data can contribute to setting the categories apart.","author":[{"family":"Liesenfeld","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Hsu","given":"Yu-Yin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"liesenfeld_2020_predicting","container-title":"Proceedings of the 34th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation","event-place":"Hanoi, Vietnam","event-title":"PACLIC","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10]]},"license":"All rights reserved","page":"157–166","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Hanoi, Vietnam","title":"Predicting Gender and Age Categories in English Conversations Using Lexical, Non-Lexical, and Turn-Taking Features","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2020.paclic-1.19"},

Everyone has heard of the Scrolls, but amidst the conspiracies, the politics, and the sensational claims, it can be difficult to separate the myths from the reality. In this Very Short introductions, Timothy Lim discusses the cultural significance of the finds, and the religious, political and legal controversies during the seventy years of study since the discovery. He also looks at the contribution the Scrolls have made to our understanding of the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible, and the origins of early Christianity. Exploring the most recent scholarly discussions on the archaeology of Khirbet Qumran, and the study of the biblical texts, the canon, and the history of the Second Temple Period, he considers what the scrolls reveal about sectarianism in early Judaism. Was the archaeological site of Qumran a centre of monastic life, a fortress, a villa, or a pottery factory? Why were some of their biblical texts so different from the ones that we read today? Did they have 'a Bible'? Who were the Essenes and why did they think that humanity is to be divided between 'the sons of light' and those in darkness?

  {"id":"lippi_2013_chocolate","abstract":"Throughout history, chocolate has been used to treat a wide variety of ailments, and in recent years, multiple studies have found that chocolate can have positive health effects, providing evidence to a centuries-long established use; this acknowledgement, however, did not have a straight course, having been involved in religious, medical and cultural controversies. Christian Europe, in fact, feared the exhilarating effects of new drinks, such as chocolate, coffee and tea. Therefore, these beverages would have been banished, had not doctors and scientists explained that they were good for the body. The scientific debate, which reached its peak in Florence in the 18th century, regarded the therapeutic effectiveness of the various chocolate components: it was necessary to know their properties first, in order to prepare the best cacao concoction for every patient. When Dietetics separated from Medicine, however, chocolate acquired the role of vehicle for easing the administration of bitter medicines, being associated to different health problems. The recent rediscovery of the beneficial use of cacao and chocolate focuses upon its value as supplemental nutrition. Building a bridge to the past may be helpful to detect the areas where the potential health benefits of chocolate are likely to be further explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Lippi","given":"Donatella"}],"citation-key":"lippi_2013_chocolate","container-title":"Nutrients","container-title-short":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu5051573","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5,14]]},"language":"en","page":"1573-1584","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chocolate in History: Food, Medicine, Medi-Food","title-short":"Chocolate in History","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/5/5/1573","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"loewe_1971_spices","abstract":"The earliest steps that led to the exchange of ideas, skills, and material goods between the cultures of the East and the West will probably never be more than a matter of surmise; but the literary and archaeological sources of information that start as a slender trickle at the beginning of the Christian era soon develop into a mighty stream and disclose a tale of human endeavour and ingenuity which few historians can fail to find fascinating and stimulating. During the last half-century or so dedicated scholars such as Pelliot have devoted their major research efforts to the meticulous consideration of the minutiae involved in the subject; and, more recently, Joseph Needham has contrived both to continue the work of such predecessors and to draw some of the major conclusions that are the fruits of basic research conducted in several disciplines. Probably the full story of these exchanges can never be told; for the evidence is sadly deficient; balanced inferences that rely on information gathered from both East and West are rarely possible; and, maddeningly enough, the political restrictions of the 20th century now prevent the application of the modern techniques of archaeology, geography, and anthropology in areas where they are most likely to be successful.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Loewe","given":"Michael"}],"citation-key":"loewe_1971_spices","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland","container-title-short":"J.R.

A form and frequency analysis of a set of 16 ‘pure’ swear word lemma forms is presented. The findings reveal that swearing occurrence is significantly lower in the Spoken BNC2014 but still within a comparable range to previous studies. Furthermore, FUCK is found to overtake BLOODY as the most popular swear word lemma. Finally, the social distribution of swearing across gender and age groups generally supports the findings of previous research: males still swear more than females, and swearing still peaks in the twenties and declines thereafter. However, the distribution of swearing according to socio-economic status is found to be more complex than expected in the 2010s and requires further investigation.

  {"id":"love_2023_corpuspragmatic","abstract":"This study examines the pragmatic functions of fuck among British English teenagers in casual conversation in two youth language corpora from the 1990s and 2010s. It applies a corpus-pragmatics approach to explore how the ongoing weakening of the taboo strength of fuck in the perception of young speakers is realised in usage data. The major functions observed involve a predominance of idiomatic, emphatic and emotionally expressive functions. Conversely, usage associated with potentially abusive functions, including literal reference to sexual intercourse, is infrequent. Our observations are interpreted in the context of delexicalization and related long-term diachronic processes, whereby contemporary usage of fuck among teenagers is characterised in terms of semidelexicalized, pragmatically strengthened usage with weakened taboo status. The article also evaluates the interpretation of idiomatic usage from a functional perspective, and contributes to methodological considerations of the use of spoken corpora for pragmatic research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Love","given":"Robbie"},{"family":"Stenstrom","given":"Anna-Brita"}],"citation-key":"love_2023_corpuspragmatic","container-title":"Journal of Pragmatics","container-title-short":"Journal of Pragmatics","DOI":"10.1016/j.pragma.2023.08.008","ISSN":"03782166","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10]]},"language":"en","page":"167-181","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Corpus-pragmatic perspectives on the contemporary weakening of fuck: The case of teenage British English conversation","title-short":"Corpus-pragmatic perspectives on the contemporary weakening of fuck","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378216623002163","volume":"216"},

  {"id":"lu_2017_extraoral","abstract":"Bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs or T2Rs) belong to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors, which are the targets of >50% of drugs currently on the market. Canonically, T2Rs are located in taste buds of the tongue, where they initiate bitter taste perception. However, accumulating evidence indicates that T2Rs are widely expressed throughout the body and mediate diverse nontasting roles through various specialized mechanisms. It has also become apparent that T2Rs and their polymorphisms are associated with human disorders. In this review, we summarize the physiological and pathophysiological roles that extraoral T2Rs play in processes as diverse as innate immunity and reproduction, and the major challenges in this emerging field.","author":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Cheng-Hai"},{"family":"Lifshitz","given":"Lawrence M."},{"family":"ZhuGe","given":"Ronghua"}],"citation-key":"lu_2017_extraoral","container-title":"Journal of General Physiology","DOI":"10.1085/jgp.201611637","ISSN":"0022-1295","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"page":"181-197","title":"Extraoral Bitter Taste Receptors in Health and Disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.201611637","volume":"149"},

  {"id":"luo_2023_othering","abstract":"Identifying and understanding implicit attitudes toward food can help efforts to mitigate social prejudice due to food’s pervasive role as a marker of cultural and ethnic identity. Stereotypes about food are a form of microaggression that contribute to harmful public discourse that may in turn perpetuate prejudice toward ethnic groups and negatively impact economic outcomes for restaurants. Through careful linguistic analyses, we evaluate social theories about attitudes toward immigrant cuisine in a large-scale study of framing differences in 2.1M English language Yelp reviews of restaurants in 14 US states. Controlling for factors such as restaurant price and neighborhood racial diversity, we find that immigrant cuisines are more likely to be framed in objectifying and othering terms of authenticity (e.g., authentic, traditional), exoticism (e.g., exotic, different), and prototypicality (e.g., typical, usual), but that non-Western immigrant cuisines (e.g., Indian, Mexican) receive more othering than European cuisines (e.g., French, Italian). We further find that non-Western immigrant cuisines are framed less positively and as lower status, being evaluated in terms of affordability and hygiene. Finally, we show that reviews generated by large language models (LLMs) reproduce many of the same framing tendencies. Our results empirically corroborate social theories of taste and gastronomic stereotyping, and reveal linguistic processes by which such attitudes are reified.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Yiwei"},{"family":"Gligorić","given":"Kristina"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"luo_2023_othering","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,14]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2307.07645","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Othering and low prestige framing of immigrant cuisines in US restaurant reviews and large language models","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07645"},

  {"id":"lynott_2020_lancaster","abstract":"Sensorimotor information plays a fundamental role in cognition. However, the existing materials that measure the sensorimotor basis of word meanings and concepts have been restricted in terms of their sample size and breadth of sensorimotor experience. Here we present norms of sensorimotor strength for 39,707 concepts across six perceptual modalities (touch, hearing, smell, taste, vision, and interoception) and five action effectors (mouth/throat, hand/arm, foot/leg, head excluding mouth/throat, and torso), gathered from a total of 3,500 individual participants using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. The Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms are unique and innovative in a number of respects: They represent the largest-ever set of semantic norms for English, at 40,000 words × 11 dimensions (plus several informative cross-dimensional variables), they extend perceptual strength norming to the new modality of interoception, and they include the first norming of action strength across separate bodily effectors. In the first study, we describe the data collection procedures, provide summary descriptives of the dataset, and interpret the relations observed between sensorimotor dimensions. We then report two further studies, in which we (1) extracted an optimal singlevariable composite of the 11-dimension sensorimotor profile (Minkowski 3 strength) and (2) demonstrated the utility of both perceptual and action strength in facilitating lexical decision times and accuracy in two separate datasets. These norms provide a valuable resource to researchers in diverse areas, including psycholinguistics, grounded cognition, cognitive semantics, knowledge representation, machine learning, and big-data approaches to the analysis of language and conceptual representations. The data are accessible via the Open Science Framework (http://osf.io/7emr6/) and an interactive web application (https://www. lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/lsnorms/).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Lynott","given":"Dermot"},{"family":"Connell","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Brysbaert","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Brand","given":"James"},{"family":"Carney","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"lynott_2020_lancaster","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-019-01316-z","ISSN":"1554-3528","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","page":"1271-1291","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms: multidimensional measures of perceptual and action strength for 40,000 English words","title-short":"The Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13428-019-01316-z","volume":"52"},

These principalities are assigned to the historical record by inscriptions using Indian languages and scripts, stone remains attesting Hindu and Buddhist cults, and foreign accounts, mostly Chinese, indicating various features of Indian culture. Two of the questions which underlie historical studies of this evidence are: how did Indian influence spread through Southeast Asia? and, how far did Indian influence dominate Southeast Asia? In principle, these questions may be answered independently of each other, the first being chiefly concerned with the “Indianization I” discussed in an earlier article, the second with “Indianization II”. Attention will be directed here chiefly to the first, and to the second primarily only to the extent that is entailed by examination of the first. Various conflicting views have been advanced by historians; the purpose here is to suggest that, in the absence of convincing evidence for any one of them, an eclectic interpretation is not only legitimate but cogent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Mabbett","given":"I.

Tracing this process to the origins of the Arabic language, rather than the advent of Islam, Tim Mackintosh-Smith begins his narrative more than a thousand years before Muhammad and focuses on how Arabic, both spoken and written, has functioned as a vital source of shared cultural identity over the millennia. Mackintosh-Smith reveals how linguistic developments-from pre-Islamic poetry to the growth of script, Muhammad's use of writing, and the later problems of printing Arabic-have helped and hindered the progress of Arab history, and investigates how, even in today's politically fractured post-Arab Spring environment, Arabic itself is still a source of unity and disunity","author":[{"family":"Mackintosh-Smith","given":"Tim"}],"call-number":"DS218 .M28 2019","citation-key":"mackintosh-smith_2019_arabs","event-place":"New Haven, CT","ISBN":"978-0-300-18028-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: on1048940075","number-of-pages":"630","publisher":"Yale University Press","publisher-place":"New Haven, CT","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Arabs: A 3,000-year history of peoples, tribes and empires","title-short":"Arabs","type":"book"},

Thomas Madden's majestic, sprawling history of Venice is the first full portrait of the city in English in almost thirty years. Using long-buried archival material and a wealth of newly translated documents, Madden weaves a spellbinding story of a place and its people, tracing an arc from the city's humble origins as a lagoon refuge to its apex as a vast maritime empire and Renaissance epicenter to its rebirth as a modern tourist hub. Madden explores all aspects of Venice's breathtaking achievements: the construction of its unparalleled navy, its role as an economic powerhouse and birthplace of capitalism, its popularization of opera, the stunning architecture of its watery environs, and more. He sets these in the context of the rise and fall of the Byzantine Empire, the endless waves of Crusades to the Holy Land, and the awesome power of Turkish sultans. And perhaps most critically, Madden corrects the stereotype of Shakespeare's money-lending Shylock that has distorted the Venetian character, uncovering instead a much more complex and fascinating story, peopled by men and women whose ingenuity and deep faith profoundly altered the course of civilization","author":[{"family":"Madden","given":"Thomas F."}],"citation-key":"madden_2012_venice","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-101-60113-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 858947744","publisher":"Viking","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Venice: A new history","title-short":"Venice","type":"book"},

Many researches and publications deal with the ancient incense trade, but only a few focus on this trade during the Islamic period.

To identify the main substances used as incense, medieval Arabic sources such as the Kitāb al-nabāt written by Al-AsmacI and Abū Hanīfah al-Dlnawarl, or Ibn al-Baytâr's al-Jãmic li-mufradāt al-adwiyyah wa-H-aghdhiyyah are of great interest.

  {"id":"magyari_2022_hungarian","abstract":"Powerful figures, such as politicians, who show a behavioural pattern of exuberant self-confidence, recklessness, and contempt for others may be the subject of the acquired personality disorder, the hubris syndrome, which has been demonstrated to leave its mark on speech patterns. Our study explores characteristic language patterns of Hungarian prime ministers (PMs) with a special emphasis on one of the key indicators of hubris, the shift from the first person “I” to “we” in spontaneous speech. We analyzed the ratio of the first-person singular (“I”) and plural (“we”) pronouns and verbal inflections in the spontaneous parliamentary speeches of four Hungarian PMs between 1998–2018. We found that Viktor Orba´ n during his second premiership (2010–2014) used first person plural relative to singular inflections more often than the other three PMs during their terms. Orba´ n and another Hungarian PM, Ferenc Gyurcsa´ ny, who were re-elected at some point showed an increased ratio of first-person plural vs. singular inflections and personal pronouns by their second term, likely reflecting increasing hubristic tendencies. The results show that the ratio of “I” and “we” usually studied in English texts also show changes in a structurally different language, Hungarian. This finding suggests that it is extended periods of premiership that may increase hubristic behaviour in political leaders, not only experiencing excessive power. The results are particularly elucidating regarding the role of re-elections in political leaders’ hubristic speech–and behaviour.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Magyari","given":"Lilla"},{"family":"Pléh","given":"Csaba"},{"family":"Forgács","given":"Bálint"}],"citation-key":"magyari_2022_hungarian","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0273226","editor":[{"family":"Landenmark","given":"Hanna"}],"ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,24]]},"language":"en","page":"e0273226","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Hungarian hubris syndrome","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273226","volume":"17"},
  {"id":"mahmud_2018_documenting","abstract":"Sundanese literature as other regional literatures all over Indonesia faces the same situation and problem regarding its existence. There have been some efforts made to preserve this local culture either through collaborative researches, national and international publications, or documentation. Faculty of Cultural Sciences Universitas Padjadjaran having Sundanese Study Program has made a documentation of Sundanese folklores taken from areas in West Java under the Sundanese culture as well as from books. The folklores are collected and made into a written documentation. The source text which is written in Sundanese language is then translated into Indonesian language as the first target language and into English as the second target language altogether and is published in a book entitled “The Most Popular Sundanese Folklore: Myth, Legend, and Tales” in cooperation with Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The first background of this research is that although the folklores are taken from different areas of West Java, there are some similar topics involved. The second background is that the translators of the two target languages have both a Sundanese cultural background however they have their own preferable methods in translating the folklore. Based on the two backgrounds, this research aims to identify what similar topics appeared in the folklore and what method of translation is used to transfer the similar contents into Indonesian language and English language studied by using Newmark’s methods of translation. The results show that the first similar topic in the Sundanese folklore is about kingdom including the king and the queen, the prince and princess, then the second is about the childless family, the third is about the existence of snake or dragon, the fourth is about meditating in a forest or a mountain, and the last is relating to Islam or a Moslem. The method of translation used in the translation from Sundanese language into Indonesian language is of SL emphasis while the method used in the translation from Sundanese language into English is of TL emphasis.","author":[{"family":"Mahmud","given":"Erlina Zulkifli"},{"family":"Ampera","given":"Taufik"},{"family":"Sidiq","given":"Inu Isnaeni"}],"citation-key":"mahmud_2018_documenting","container-title":"Advances in Social Science, Education and Humanities Research","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"417-429","source":"Zotero","title":"Documenting Sundanese Literature by the Presentation of Its Folklores Written in Three Languages","type":"article-journal","volume":"280"},

Interoperability is obtained by applying the Linked Open Data principles. Particularly, an extensive collection of Latin lemmas is used to link the (distributed) resources. For the etymology, we rely on the Ontolex-lemon ontology and the lemonEty extension to model the information, while the source data are taken from a recent etymological dictionary of Latin. As a result, the collection of lemmas LiLa is built around now includes 1,465 Proto-Italic and 1,393 Proto-Indo-European reconstructed forms that are used to explain the history of 1,400 Latin words.

  {"id":"manning_2018_open","abstract":"A major new economic history of the ancient Mediterranean world   In <em>The Open Sea</em>, J. G. Manning offers a major new history of economic life in the Mediterranean world in the Iron Age, from Phoenician trading down to the Hellenistic era and the beginning of Rome's imperial supremacy. Drawing on a wide range of ancient sources and the latest social theory, Manning suggests that a search for an illusory single \"ancient economy\" has obscured the diversity of lived experience in the Mediterranean world, including both changes in political economies over time and differences in cultural conceptions of property and money. At the same time, he shows how the region's economies became increasingly interconnected during this period.   <em>The Open Sea</em> argues that the keys to understanding the region's rapid social and economic change during the Iron Age are the variety of economic and political solutions its different cultures devised, the patterns of cross-cultural exchange, and the sharp environmental contrasts between Egypt, the Near East, and Greece and Rome. The book examines long-run drivers of change, such as climate, together with the most important economic institutions of the premodern Mediterranean--coinage, money, agriculture, and private property. It also explores the role of economic growth, states, and legal institutions in the region's various economies.   A groundbreaking economic history of the ancient Mediterranean world,<em>The Open Sea</em> shows that the origins of the modern economy extend far beyond Greece and Rome.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,3]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Manning","given":"J.

  {"id":"mark_2018_notes","abstract":"This paper evaluates Chinese lexical data in Shorto’s 2006 Proto-Mon-Khmer reconstructions to prevent misapplication of his reconstructions, which in a few dozen instances are based on problematic data that affect or even refute his reconstructions. First, Shorto notes about 20 Chinese items to consider for their comparable semantic and phonological properties. While several are probable Chinese loanwords spread throughout the region, a majority of these are unlikely to be Chinese as they are either Wanderwörter seen in multiple language families with undetermined origins or, in most cases, simply partial chance similarities, and these latter items can thus be removed from consideration in Proto-Austroasiatic reconstructions. Second, Shorto also listed about 50 Vietnamese words as supporting data for proto-Austroasiatic etyma which are either (a) clearly Sino-Vietnamese readings of Chinese characters (about 20 instances) or (b) Early Sino-Vietnamese colloquial borrowings (about 30 instances). Many of those proposed proto-Austroasiatic reconstructions must be reconsidered due to the exclusion of these Sino-Vietnamese items. While excluding such Sino-Vietnamese or Early Sino-Vietnamese items in some cases has no impact on those reconstructions, other exclusions result in slight changes in the reconstructed forms, and in several cases, proposed reconstructions must be entirely excluded as only Vietnamese and one other branch of Austroasiatic are available as comparative evidence. Finally, both the exclusions of proposed attestations (and the clarification of their actual origin) and the hypotheses of regional spread of Chinese words must be considered not only for Proto-Austroasiatic but also in comparative historical linguistic studies in the region.","author":[{"family":"Mark","given":"Alves"}],"citation-key":"mark_2018_notes","container-title":"Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"page":"lxxvi-xcvii","title":"Notes on Chinese Words in Shorto’s Proto-Austroasiatic Reconstructions","type":"Journal Article","volume":"11"},

After the collapse of the Arab rule, the Arab territorial expanses and cultural heritage were taken over by the Turks. Although scientific progress in the Turkish period slowed down due to numerous unfavorable political-economic and other circumstances, thanks to the Turks, Arab culture and useful Islamic principles expanded to the territory of our homeland of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Significant role in the transfer of Arabic medical and pharmaceutical knowledge was also attributed to the Sephardic Jews who, with their arrival, continued to perform their attar activities, which were largely based on Arab achievements. However, insufficiently elaborated, rich funds of oriental medical and pharmaceutical handwriting testify that Oriental science has nurtured in these areas as well, and that the Arab component in a specific way was intertwined with other cultures and traditions of Bosnia and Herzegovina.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Masic","given":"Izet"},{"family":"Skrbo","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Naser","given":"Nabil"},{"family":"Tandir","given":"Salih"},{"family":"Zunic","given":"Lejla"},{"family":"Medjedovic","given":"Senad"},{"family":"Sukalo","given":"Aziz"}],"citation-key":"masic_2017_contribution","container-title":"Medical Archives","container-title-short":"Med Arch","DOI":"10.5455/medarh.2017.71.364-372","ISSN":"0350-199X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"364","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Contribution of Arabic Medicine and Pharmacy to the Development of Health Care Protection in Bosnia and Herzegovina - the First Part","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.ejmanager.com/fulltextpdf.php?mno=282485","volume":"71"},

  {"id":"mathe_2015_medicinal","abstract":"Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 % of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.","citation-key":"mathe_2015_medicinal","collection-title":"Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-017-9810-5","editor":[{"family":"Máthé","given":"Ákos"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-017-9810-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","title":"Medicinal and aromatic plants of the world: Scientific, production, commercial and utilization aspects","type":"book"},

  {"id":"mcgillivray_2020_applying","abstract":"“McGillivray and Tóth provide a very comprehensible introduction to the most important current approaches of computer-aided text analysis in the Digital Humanities. By giving illustrative examples and many practical tips, they let the reader participate in their vast experience in this quickly evolving field of research.”–Gregor Wiedemann, University of Hamburg, Germany This book presents established and state-of-the-art methods in Language Technology (including text mining, corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural language processing), and demonstrates how they can be applied by humanities scholars working with textual data. The landscape of humanities research has recently changed thanks to the proliferation of big data and large textual collections such as Google Books, Early English Books Online, and Project Gutenberg. These resources have yet to be fully explored by new generations of scholars, and the authors argue that Language Technology has a key role to play in the exploration of large-scale textual data. The authors use a series of illustrative examples from various humanistic disciplines (mainly but not exclusively from History, Classics, and Literary Studies) to demonstrate basic and more complex use-case scenarios. This book will be useful to graduate students and researchers in humanistic disciplines working with textual data, including History, Modern Languages, Literary studies, Classics, and Linguistics. This is also a very useful book for anyone teaching or learning Digital Humanities and interested in the basic concepts from computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, and natural language processing. Barbara McGillivray is a Turing Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge and The Alan Turing Institute, UK. She has published two monographs, Methods in Latin Computational Linguistics (2014) and Quantitative Historical Linguistics. A corpus framework (2017).

Her richly lyrical phrases capture both the fear and the beauty of growing up in a rural working-class community, anchored by the magical bond between a young girl and her grandfather. Way's Mills, Quebec, is the setting for these poems, although as with Mark Twain's Mississippi, place becomes a place in the heart in this elegy for lost ancestral farms. Standish McIntyre gives voice to the unspoken, shining a light into the dark corners of our collective memory to reveal an indelible past that gleams with clarity, empathy, and humanity. Taking seed in the dilapidated barns and warm sunlit rooms of Standish McIntyre's personal history, these poems weave a filigree of well-worn remembrances and time-honoured treaties of the self, half forgotten yet ever lingering.

  {"id":"menzies_2021_ordering","abstract":"\"English-language literature on the history of science is still stubbornly Euro-centric, and international scholarly discourse has engaged insufficiently with Chinese resources that document sophisticated premodern knowledge of the natural world. The case of botany is especially useful for investigating \"traditional\" systems of organization, classification, observation, and description and their transition to \"modern\" ones. China's vast and ancient body of documented knowledge about plants is best known but not limited to a rich corpus of Materia Medica. Written sources include horticultural manuals and monographs, comprehensive encyclopedias, geographies, and specialized anthologies of verse and prose. Their authors were keen observers of nature. Until the late nineteenth century, however, their intent was to inquire into and to verify what had been written about plants in the referential classical texts rather than to deploy a set of diagnostic tools using a common terminology and methodology to identify and explain new and unknown species or properties. Ordering the Myriad Things is the story of how traditional knowledge of plants in China gave way to scientific botany over a period of about a hundred years between 1850 and 1950. A dramatic shift occurred during this period, from the \"traditional\" study and representation of plants as objects steeped in a rich cultural heritage to the \"scientific\" study of plants and organisms in a hierarchy of taxonomic relationships to other plants, and investigations of their broader ecological status. This shift not only expanded the universe of plants beyond the familiar to encompass unknown species and unknown geographies, but fueled a new knowledge of China itself\"--","author":[{"family":"Menzies","given":"Nicholas K."}],"call-number":"QK21.C6 M46 2021","citation-key":"menzies_2021_ordering","collection-title":"Culture, place, and nature : studies in anthropology and environment","event-place":"Seattle","ISBN":"978-0-295-74945-7 978-0-295-74946-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"number-of-pages":"288","publisher":"University of Washington Press","publisher-place":"Seattle","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Ordering the myriad things: from traditional knowledge to scientific botany in China","title-short":"Ordering the myriad things","type":"book"},

This analysis also introduces three actors of different political agendas who applied a similar PR tool of cultural diplomacy to elicit international sympathy for their homeland. After briefly surveying the primary stimuli of cultural diplomacy in interwar Hungary and RepublicanEra China, I turn to pre-1949 Sino-Hungarian cultural approaches in the era of no formal diplomatic relations. Such initiatives offer valuable insights into the history of cultural diplomacy while also highlighting significant parallels with the present. Specifically, I introduce the political and cultural agenda of three individuals acting as cultural ambassadors to their homelands. The Shanghai Jewish refugee aid organizer, Paul Komor, and the women’s association president, Theresia Moll, were members of the Hungarian diaspora in China. They introduced the post-Habsburg Central European region to a cosmopolitan community while exhibiting two different foci: Hungarian irredentism and pan-Danubianism. Meanwhile, Zhenya He, a Kuomintang propagandist and the University of Budapest’s first Chinese language instructor during the 1930s, synthesized Hungarian pan-Asian Turanism with Sun Yat-sen’s Tridemism to further Sino-Hungarian exchanges.","author":[{"family":"Mervay","given":"Mátyás"}],"citation-key":"mervay__history","language":"en","page":"17","source":"Zotero","title":"Toward a History of Interwar Sino-Hungarian Cultural Relations: Three Advocates of Kuomintang Soft Power, Hungarian Irredentism and Pan-Danubianism","type":"article-journal"},

But how does food, be it industrial or small scale, local or international, nutritious or unhealthy get to our plate? This book shows us how. Stories that inform us about how food moves from the producer to the consumer are only just appearing and are timely relative to the developments in food distribution. Without understanding the complex and adaptive global food supply chain, consumers, policy makers, and the food industry fail to appreciate the full range of opportunities for innovation. Farmers are increasingly engineers, farms are becoming enclosed vertical structures or laboratories with no plant or animal in sight. Food may arrive on our plates from food printers, lab dishes, or from our very own farms that produce personalized food in our homes. The possibilities and consequences are only now becoming visible. No more an invisible supply chain, the future food system will operate transparently and faster. This is a global story, one that centers on urban centers, connected by a network and infrastructure that includes roads, storage facilities, waterways, ports, highways, and airfreight hubs. These stories also reveal a shift in the way we can think about supplying the global population with food in the future. Could it be that the world already produces enough food for the world now and will continue to do so in the future....and that the critical problem to solve is one of distribution? Could it be that our food will become information, data that will uproot our food system and transplant it into a faster, fresher supply chain that feeds our growing urban populations?\"--","author":[{"family":"Metcalfe","given":"Robyn Shotwell"}],"call-number":"HD9000.5 .M4275 2019","citation-key":"metcalfe_2019_food","event-place":"Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-262-03965-9 978-0-262-53952-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"195","publisher":"The MIT Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, MA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Food routes: Growing bananas in Iceland and other tales from the logistics of eating","title-short":"Food routes","type":"book"},

  {"id":"mezzavilla_2014_genetic","abstract":"Background The ancient Silk Road has been a trading route between Europe and Central Asia from the 2nd century BCE to the 15th century CE. While most populations on this route have been characterized, the genetic background of others remains poorly understood, and little is known about past migration patterns. The scientific expedition “Marco Polo” has recently collected genetic and phenotypic data in six regions (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan) along the Silk Road to study the genetics of a number of phenotypes.Results We characterized the genetic structure of these populations within a worldwide context. We observed a West-East subdivision albeit the existence of a genetic component shared within Central Asia and nearby populations from Europe and Near East. We observed a contribution of up to 50% from Europe and Asia to most of the populations that have been analyzed. The contribution from Asia dates back to 25 generations and is limited to the Eastern Silk Road. Time and direction of this contribution are consistent with the Mongolian expansion era.Conclusions We clarified the genetic structure of six populations from Central Asia and suggested a complex pattern of gene flow among them. We provided a map of migration events in time and space and we quantified exchanges among populations. Altogether these novel findings will support the future studies aimed at understanding the genetics of the phenotypes that have been collected during the Marco Polo campaign, they will provide insights into the history of these populations, and they will be useful to reconstruct the developments and events that have shaped modern Eurasians genomes.","author":[{"family":"Mezzavilla","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Vozzi","given":"Diego"},{"family":"Pirastu","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Girotto","given":"Giorgia"},{"family":"Adamo","given":"Pio","non-dropping-particle":"d’"},{"family":"Gasparini","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Colonna","given":"Vincenza"}],"citation-key":"mezzavilla_2014_genetic","container-title":"bioRxiv","DOI":"10.1101/011759","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"page":"011759","title":"Genetic landscape of populations along the Silk Road: admixture and migration patterns","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/11/24/011759.abstract"},

This paper argues that before the arrival of Buddhism, elite scent culture had already begun to be transformed by the importation of foreign aromatics, though these substances arrived shorn of their original cultural context. Prior to the importing of intense foreign perfumes, the aromatics available were mostly local, and traditional Chinese practice stressed the use of individual scents in religious contexts, a concept which also had a profound influence on secular usage. The same is true of early osmographies, which link particular kinds of smells—including many that might be considered unpleasant—to the changing seasons. When foreign spices and aromatics arrived in China for the first time, a phenomenon later literature specifically associates with the reign of Han Wudi, this resulted in the development of new complex and powerful perfumes. This in turn may have had a significant impact upon the material culture of Han China, with the spread of personal scenting devices and incense burners.","author":[{"family":"Milburn","given":"Olivia"}],"citation-key":"milburn_2016_aromas","container-title":"Journal of the American Oriental Society","container-title-short":"JAOS","DOI":"10.7817/jameroriesoci.136.3.0441","ISSN":"0003-0279","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"441-464","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Aromas, scents, and spices: Olfactory culture in China before the arrival of Buddhism","title-short":"Aromas, Scents, and Spices","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://lockwoodonlinejournals.com/index.php/jaos/article/view/1362","volume":"136"},
  {"id":"milburn_2021_empress","abstract":"\"Zhao Feiyan (45-1 BCE), the second empress appointed by Emperor Cheng of the Han dynasty (207 BCE-220 CE), was born in slavery and trained in the performing arts, a background that made her appointment as empress highly controversial. Subsequent persecution by her political enemies eventually led to her being forced to commit suicide. After her death, her reputation was marred by accusations of vicious scheming, murder of other consorts and their offspring, and relentless promiscuity, punctuated by bouts of extravagant shopping. This first book-length study of Zhao Feiyan and her literary legacy includes a complete translation of The Scandalous Tale of Zhao Feiyan (Zhao Feiyan waizhuan), a Tang dynasty (618-907 CE) erotic novella that describes in great detail the decadent lifestyle enjoyed by imperial favorites in the harem of Emperor Cheng. This landmark text was crucial for establishing writings about palace women as the accepted forum for discussing sexual matters, including fetishism, obsession, jealousy, incompatibility in marriage, and so on. Using historical documentation, Olivia Milburn reconstructs the evolution of Zhao Feiyan's story and illuminates the broader context of palace life for women and the novella's social influence\"--","author":[{"family":"Milburn","given":"Olivia"}],"call-number":"PL2663.L45 Z4336 2021","citation-key":"milburn_2021_empress","event-place":"Seattle","ISBN":"978-0-295-74874-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Washington Press","publisher-place":"Seattle","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The empress in the pepper chamber: Zhao Feiyan in history and fiction","title-short":"The empress in the pepper chamber","type":"book"},

  {"id":"milton_2016_ministry","abstract":"Six gentlemen, one goal - the destruction of Hitler's war machine In the spring of 1939, a top secret organisation was founded in London: its purpose was to plot the destruction of Hitler's war machine through spectacular acts of sabotage. The guerrilla campaign that followed was to prove every bit as extraordinary as the six gentlemen who directed it. Winston Churchill selected them because they were wildly creative and thoroughly ungentlemanly. One of them, Cecil Clarke, was a maverick engineer who had spent the 1930s inventing futuristic caravans. Now, his talents were put to more devious use: he built the dirty bomb used to assassinate Hitler's favourite, Reinhard Heydrich. Another member of the team, William Fairbairn, was a portly pensioner with an unusual passion: he was the world's leading expert in silent killing. He was hired to train the guerrillas being parachuted behind enemy lines. Led by dapper Scotsman Colin Gubbins, these men - along with three others - formed a secret inner circle that planned the most audacious sabotage attacks of the Second World War. Winston Churchill called it his Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. The six 'ministers', aided by a group of formidable ladies, were so effective that they single-handedly changed the course of the war. Told with Giles Milton's trademark verve and eye for detail, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is thoroughly researched and based on hitherto unknown archival material.

  {"id":"ming_2019_zheng","abstract":"In the history of the development of human civilization, the Silk Road has been an important route of traffic and exchange between the East and the West. From Zhang Qian’s 張騫 opening up of the Silk Road across the Western Regions (Xiyue 西域) to Zheng He’s 鄭和 sailing to the Western Oceans (xia xiyang 下西洋) more than 1500 years later, China had a continuous desire to explore beyond its borders. At the time of Zheng He, the term “Western Oceans” (xiyang 西 洋 ) had a specific meaning. As shown by the account of Ma Huan 馬歡, who personally joined Zheng He on the voyages, the people of Ming China considered the “Western Oceans” to be the Namoli Ocean (Namoli yang 那没黎洋), later called the Indian Ocean. Thus, it could be concluded that the Western Oceans where Zheng He’s fleet went meant the Indian Ocean. Even today most scholars still divide the Eastern and Western Oceans at Brunei, with no clear understanding of where the Western Oceans to which Zheng He sailed were actually located. It is therefore important to make clear that the Western Oceans in his time referred to the Indian Ocean, before moving on to investigate the purpose of the voyages and related historical issues. Even more important is to point out that Zheng He’s expeditions in the early fifteenth century reflected that Chinese people took to the seas on a scale larger than ever before and joined the maritime and overland silk routes together. The place where this occurred was the Indian Ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ming","given":"Wan"}],"citation-key":"ming_2019_zheng","container-title":"China and Asia","container-title-short":"China Asia","DOI":"10.1163/2589465X-00101004","ISSN":"2589-4641, 2589-465X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"92-125","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Zheng He’s Seven Voyages into the Namoli Ocean–the Indian Ocean","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/cahs/1/1/article-p92_92.xml","volume":"1"},

We wish to formalize legal issues in a computable language, using SUMO and its higher-order language to capture the semantics of the legal domain, which in itself is relying on many quasi-logical rules. SUMO is a formal ontology that had 1000 terms and 4000 axioms in the beginning, using those terms in SUO-KIF statements that describe the world. This set has since been expanded to more than 20,000 terms and 80,000 axioms. In this paper, we show how and why legal terms have been represented in SUMO.

But as the vast Roman Empire disintegrated, so did appreciation of these precious texts. Christianity cast a shadow over so-called pagan thought, books were burned, and the library of Alexandria, the greatest repository of classical knowledge, was destroyed. Yet some texts did survive and The Map of Knowledge explores the role played by seven cities around the Mediterranean--rare centers of knowledge in a dark world, where scholars supported by enlightened heads of state collected, translated and shared manuscripts. In 8th century Baghdad, Arab discoveries augmented Greek learning. Exchange within the thriving Muslim world brought that knowledge to Cordoba, Spain. Toledo became a famous center of translation from Arabic into Latin, a portal through which Greek and Arab ideas reached Western Europe. Salerno, on the Italian coast, was the great center of medical studies, and Sicily, ancient colony of the Greeks, was one of the few places in the West to retain contact with Greek culture and language. Scholars in these cities helped classical ideas make their way to Venice in the 15th century, where printers thrived and the Renaissance took root.

  {"id":"montanari_2015_medieval","abstract":"\"In his new history of food, acclaimed historian Massimo Montanari traces the development of medieval tastes--both culinary and cultural--from raw materials to market and captures their reflections in today's food trends. Tying the ingredients of our diet evolution to the growth of human civilization, he immerses readers in the passionate debates and bold inventions that transformed food from a simple staple to a potent factor in health and a symbol of social and ideological standing. Montanari returns to the prestigious Salerno school of medicine, the \"mother of all medical schools,\" to plot the theory of food that took shape in the twelfth century. He reviews the influence of the Near Eastern spice routes, which introduced new flavors and cooking techniques to European kitchens, and reads Europe's earliest cookbooks, which took cues from old Roman practices that valued artifice and mixed flavors. Dishes were largely low-fat, and meats and fish were seasoned with vinegar, citrus juices, and wine. He highlights other dishes, habits, and battles that mirror contemporary culinary identity, including the refinement of pasta, polenta, bread, and other flour-based foods; the transition to more advanced cooking tools and formal dining implements; the controversy over cooking with oil, lard, or butter; dietary regimens; and the consumption and cultural meaning of water and wine. As people became more cognizant of their physicality, individuality, and place in the cosmos, Montanari shows, they adopted a new attitude toward food, investing as much in its pleasure and possibilities as in its acquisition.\"--Jacket","author":[{"family":"Montanari","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Archer Brombert","given":"Beth"}],"call-number":"394.120 940902","citation-key":"montanari_2015_medieval","collection-title":"Arts and traditions of the table","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-231-16786-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"publisher":"Columbia University Press","publisher-place":"New York","source":"BnF ISBN","title":"Medieval tastes: Food, cooking, and the table","title-short":"Medieval tastes","type":"book"},

  {"id":"moraga_2009_metabolite","abstract":"Saffron, the desiccated stigmas of Crocus sativus, is highly appreciated for its peculiar colour, ﬂavour and aroma. Several studies have been conducted with the spice, but little is known about the evolution of volatile and non-volatile compounds generated during the development of the stigma. In this study, we have followed these compounds, with special attention to those of isoprenoid origin (carotenoids and monoterpenes), which are responsible for the organoleptic properties of saffron. The main compounds that accumulated throughout stigma development in C. sativus were crocetin, its glucoside derivatives and picrocrocin, all of which increased as stigmas reached a fully developed stage. The volatile composition of C. sativus stigmas changed notably as stigmas developed with each developmental stage being characterized by a different volatile combination. In red stigmas, b-cyclocitral, the 7,8 cleavage product of b-carotene, was highly produced, suggesting the implication of both b-carotene and zeaxanthin in crocetin formation. As stigmas matured, hydroxy-b-ionone and b-ionone were produced while safranal, the most typical aroma compound of the processed spice, was only detected at low levels. However, a safranalrelated compound 2,2,2-trimethyl-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione (4-oxoisophorone) increased rapidly at the anthesis stage and also in senescent stigmas. Monoterpenes were mainly emitted at the time of anthesis and the emission patterns followed the expression patterns of two putative terpene synthases CsTS1 and CsTS2. Fatty acid derivates, which predominated at the earlier developmental stages, were observed at low levels in later stages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Moraga","given":"Ángela Rubio"},{"family":"Rambla","given":"José Luis"},{"family":"Ahrazem","given":"Oussama"},{"family":"Granell","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Gómez-Gómez","given":"Lourdes"}],"citation-key":"moraga_2009_metabolite","container-title":"Phytochemistry","container-title-short":"Phytochemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.04.022","ISSN":"00319422","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"language":"en","page":"1009-1016","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metabolite and target transcript analyses during Crocus sativus stigma development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0031942209001757","volume":"70"},

It evaluates the impact of foreign cultures-Greek and Persian, Jewish and Christian-on early Islam, accounts for the crystallization of the Sunni and Shi'i forms of the faith, and accounts for the rise of such trends as Islamic modernism and Islamism.

  {"id":"mouritsen_2014_umami","abstract":"In the West, we have identified only four basic tastes--sour, sweet, salty, and bitter--that, through skillful combination and technique, create delicious foods. Yet in many parts of East Asia over the past century, an additional flavor has entered the culinary lexicon: umami, a fifth taste impression that is savory, complex, and wholly distinct. Combining culinary history with recent research into the chemistry, preparation, nutrition, and culture of food, the authors encapsulate what we know to date about the concept of umami, from ancient times to today. Umami can be found in soup stocks, meat dishes, air-dried ham, shellfish, aged cheeses, mushrooms, and ripe tomatoes, and it can enhance other taste substances to produce a transformative gustatory experience. Researchers have also discovered which substances in foodstuffs bring out umami, a breakthrough that allows any casual cook to prepare delicious and more nutritious meals with less fat, salt, and sugar. The implications of harnessing umami are both sensuous and social, enabling us to become more intimate with the subtleties of human taste while making better food choices for ourselves and our families.

The new assistant resident, Max Havelaar, arrives in the remote regency of Lebak, preceded by his reputation as a quixotic idealist. Some think him a fool, others a genius, but \"one thing is certain: he was an unusual man, and worthy of observation.\" As Havelaar crusades against corruption, he makes a few unsettling observations of his own. Why don't the financial statements add up? Did the previous assistant resident really die a natural death? And why are his superiors obstructing his efforts to learn the truth? A few years later in Amsterdam, the stolid Dutch coffee broker Batavus Drystubble obtains Havelaar's papers from the threadbare Shawlman, who wanders the streets in search of work. Drystubble pores over the documents in the hopes of lucrative revelations about the coffee trade. But his spirited young son Frits and romanticsouled German assistant Ernest Stern discover something much more astonishing: a scandal that strikes at the heart of the whole Dutch colonial enterprise...

  {"id":"mwita_2009_adaptation","abstract":"This paper shows the processes that loanwords undergo when they are adapted from Arabic into Kiwahili. The data used is from Bosha (1993) and a constraint-based analysis is used in this paper. Although a number of studies have been carried out on Kiswahili loanwords, none that I know of has used Optimality Theory. This therefore makes the paper different from the others. Issues tackled herein include pitting the faithfulness of Kiswahili’s open syllabicity (NOCODA) against the markedness of the sonority hierarchy (SON-SEQ) in borrowed words. For example, the paper discusses whether to maintain NOCODA when syllabifying “sultani” (chief, ruler, king) as /su.lta.ni/ or whether to look at the sonority of /l/ and /t/ vis-a-vis syllable margin (SONSEQ) and thus syllabify it as /sul.ta.ni/. Occasionally in casual speech this is resolved by inserting a vowel between the consonants thus producing /su.lu.ta.ni/, but at other times prestige overrides well-formedness. Furthermore, this paper also shows that Kiswahili mainly uses vowel epenthesis to repair syllables but other procedures like consonant deletion, cluster tolerance and feature change are also used. It has also been confirmed that Kiswahili is susceptible to consonant clusters within syllables because of its long association with non-Bantu languages, mainly Arabic and English.","author":[{"family":"Mwita","given":"Leonard Chacha"}],"citation-key":"mwita_2009_adaptation","container-title":"The Journal of Pan African Studies","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"46-61","source":"Zotero","title":"The Adaptation of Swahili Loanwords From Arabic: A Constraint-Based Analysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"2"},

Drawing on his own family's history as spice traders, as well as travel narratives, historical accounts, and his expertise as an ethnobotanist, Nabhan describes the critical roles that Semitic peoples and desert floras had in setting the stage for globalized spice trade.Traveling along four prominent trade routes-the Silk Road, the Frankincense Trail, the Spice Route, and the Camino Real (for chiles and chocolate)-Nabhan follows the caravans of itinerant spice merchants from the frankincense-gathering grounds and ancient harbors of the Arabian Peninsula to the port of Zayton on the China Sea to Santa Fe in the southwest United States. His stories, recipes, and linguistic analyses of cultural diffusion routes reveal the extent to which aromatics such as cumin, cinnamon, saffron, and peppers became adopted worldwide as signature ingredients of diverse cuisines.<em>Cumin, Camels, and Caravans</em>demonstrates that two particular desert cultures often depicted in constant conflict-Arabs and Jews-have spent much of their history collaborating in the spice trade and suggests how a more virtuous multicultural globalized society may be achieved in the future.","author":[{"family":"Nabhan","given":"Gary Paul"}],"citation-key":"nabhan_2014_cumin","collection-title":"California Studies in Food and Culture","event-place":"Berkeley","ISBN":"978-0-520-26720-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher":"University of California Press","publisher-place":"Berkeley","title":"Cumin, camels, and caravans: A spice odyssey","type":"book","URL":"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520379244/cumin-camels-and-caravans"},

  {"id":"nair_2006_agronomy","abstract":"Cardamom, popularly known as the “Queen of Spices,” has a checkered history, dating back to the Vedic period (ca. 3000 bc) and is among the ingredients poured into the sacrificial fire during the Hindu marriage. Today cardamom commands a leading position among the spices of immense commercial importance and is finding its way into the dietary habits of millions around the world, even among people on the European and North American continents, hitherto unaccustomed to its use. Cardamom use ranges from a simple dietary constituent to that of immense pharmacological benefits. Although beset with many problems, both agronomic and economic, it is a safe bet that next to black pepper, cardamom will emerge in the world market as a spice of immense commercial importance. Although India was the world leader in cardamom production, starting from the 1970s the country began to slide down both in production and productivity, while Guatemala, took the leading position, although the cardamom produced there is of inferior quality. Among the primary constraints of production, is the absence of an ideotype that combines many positive traits to boost production potential, while at the same time resisting the ravages of the devastating viral disease Katte of the Karnataka State in southern India. Fertility management of cardamom soils is still rooted in classic “textbook knowledge.” This exhaustive chapter covering many aspects of the agronomy and economy of cardamom production, has also a separate chapter on the relevance of “The Nutrient Buffer Power Concept,” developed by the author, in enhancing cardamom productivity. © 2006, Elsevier Inc.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Nair","given":"Kodoth Prabhakaran"}],"citation-key":"nair_2006_agronomy","container-title":"Advances in Agronomy","DOI":"10.1016/S0065-2113(06)91004-9","editor":[{"family":"Sparks","given":"Donald L."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",1,1]]},"page":"179-471","publisher":"Academic Press","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The agronomy and economy of cardamom (<i>Elettaria cardamomum</i> M.): the “queen of spices”","title-short":"The agronomy and economy of cardamom (<i>elettaria cardamomum</i> m.)","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065211306910049","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"neffati_2017_medicinal","abstract":"Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 % of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.","author":[{"family":"Neffati","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Najjaa","given":"Hanen"},{"family":"Máthé","given":"Ákos"}],"citation-key":"neffati_2017_medicinal","collection-title":"Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-024-1120-1","event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-024-1119-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","title":"Medicinal and aromatic plants of the world - Africa","type":"book"},

  {"id":"ninfali_2005_antioxidant","abstract":"Vegetables are the most important sources of phenolics in the Mediterranean diet. Phenolics, especially flavonoids, are suggested as being essential bioactive compounds providing health benefits. In this study, twenty-seven vegetables, fifteen aromatic herbs and some spices consumed in Central Italy (the Marches region) were studied to reveal total phenolic, flavonoid and flavanol content as well as their antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) method. A comparison in terms of antioxidant capacity was made between different salads, as well as between salads to which aromatic herbs had been added. Lemon balm and marjoram at a concentration of 1·5 % w/w increased by 150 % and 200 % respectively the antioxidant capacity of a salad portion. A 200 g portion of a salad enriched with marjoram corresponded to an intake of 200 (sd 10) mg phenolics and 4000 (sd 300) ORAC units (μmol Trolox equivalents). Olive oils and wine or apple vinegars were the salad dressings that provided the highest increase in antioxidant capacity. Among the spices tested, cumin and fresh ginger made the most significant contribution to the antioxidant capacity. The results are useful in surveying the antioxidant parameters of vegetables, herbs and spices produced and consumed in our geographical area as well as in quantifying the daily intake of phenolics and ORAC units. The results can be used in public health campaigns to stimulate the consumption of vegetables able to provide significant health protection in order to prevent chronic diseases.","author":[{"family":"Ninfali","given":"Paolino"},{"family":"Mea","given":"Gloria"},{"family":"Giorgini","given":"Samantha"},{"family":"Rocchi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Bacchiocca","given":"Mara"}],"citation-key":"ninfali_2005_antioxidant","container-title":"British Journal of Nutrition","DOI":"10.1079/BJN20041327","ISSN":"0007-1145","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"257-266","title":"Antioxidant Capacity of Vegetables, Spices and Dressings Relevant to Nutrition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/antioxidant-capacity-of-vegetables-spices-and-dressings-relevant-to-nutrition/183D7C8AB9BB2E0C822812371EF1079D","volume":"93"},
  {"id":"nissim_2017_taste","abstract":"The role of bitter taste—one of the few basic taste modalities—is commonly assumed to signal toxicity and alert animals against consuming harmful compounds. However, it is known that some toxic compounds are not bitter and that many bitter compounds have negligible toxicity while having important health benefits. Here we apply a quantitative analysis of the chemical space to shed light on the bitterness-toxicity relationship. Using the BitterDB dataset of bitter molecules, The BitterPredict prediction tool, and datasets of toxic compounds, we quantify the identity and similarity between bitter and toxic compounds. About 60% of the bitter compounds have documented toxicity and only 56% of the toxic compounds are known or predicted to be bitter. The LD50 value distributions suggest that most of the bitter compounds are not very toxic, but there is a somewhat higher chance of toxicity for known bitter compounds compared to known nonbitter ones. Flavonoids and alpha acids are more common in the bitter dataset compared with the toxic dataset. In contrast, alkaloids are more common in the toxic datasets compared to the bitter dataset. Interestingly, no trend linking LD50 values with the number of activated bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) subtypes is apparent in the currently available data. This is in accord with the newly discovered expression of TAS2Rs in several extra-oral tissues, in which they might be activated by yet unknown endogenous ligands and play nongustatory physiological roles. These results suggest that bitter taste is not a very reliable marker for toxicity, and is likely to have other physiological roles.

But when did humans first come together to live in large groups, creating an urban landscape? What were these places like to inhabit? More than simply a history of ancient cities, this volume also reveals the art and architecture created by our ancestors, and provides a fascinating exploration of the origins of urbanism, politics, culture, and human interaction. Arranged geographically into five sections, Cities That Shaped the Ancient World takes a global view, beginning in the Near East with the earliest cities such as Ur and Babylon, Troy and Jerusalem. In Africa, the great cities of Ancient Egypt arose, such as Thebes and Amarna. Glorious European metropolises, including Athens and Rome, ringed the Mediterranean, but also stretched to Trier on the turbulent frontier of the Roman Empire. Asia had bustling commercial centers such as Mohenjodaro and Xianyang, while in the Americas the Mesoamerican and Peruvian cultures stamped their presence on the landscape, creating massive structures and extensive urban settlements in the deep jungles and high mountain ranges, including Caral and Teotihuacan. A team of expert historians and archaeologists with firsthand knowledge and deep appreciation of each site gives voices to these silent ruins, bringing them to life as the bustling state-of-the-art metropolises they once were","citation-key":"norwich_2014_cities","editor":[{"family":"Norwich","given":"John Julius"}],"event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-0-500-77238-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 903130399","publisher":"Thames & Hudson Inc.","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Cities that shaped the ancient world","type":"book"},

We begin with a large database of genetically related words—sets of cognates—from languages in a language family. We process the cognate sets to obtain a complete alignment of the data. We use the alignments as input to a model developed for phylogenetic reconstruction in population genetics. This is achieved via a natural novel projection of the linguistic data onto genetic primitives. As a result, we induce phylogenies based on aligned linguistic data. We place the method in the context of those reported in the literature, and illustrate its operation on data from the Uralic language family, which results in family trees that are very close to the “true” (expected) phylogenies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Nouri","given":"Javad"},{"family":"Yangarber","given":"Roman"}],"citation-key":"nouri_2016_alignment","container-title":"Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational           Language Learning","DOI":"10.18653/v1/W16-1905","event-place":"Berlin","event-title":"Proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of Computational           Language Learning","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"27-37","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Berlin","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"From alignment of etymological data to phylogenetic inference via population genetics","type":"paper-conference","URL":"http://aclweb.org/anthology/W16-1905"},

  {"id":"ogrady_2012_man","abstract":"At the time of Jesus' birth, thousands of people were leaving their families and tribes behind and flocking into brand new multi-ethnic cities. The world was undergoing the first phase of globalization, and in this ferment rulers and ruled turned to religion as a source of order and stability. The world was full of gods, competing and merging with one another. Selina O'Grady takes the reader on a journey across the empires of the ancient world and introduces us to rulers, merchants, messiahs, priests and holy men. Throughout, she seeks to answer why, amongst the countless options available, the empires at the time \"chose\" the religions they did? Why did China's rulers hitch their fate to Confucianism, a philosophy more than a religion? And why was a tiny Jewish cult eventually adopted by Rome's emperors rather than the far more popular and widespread cult of Isis? O'Grady looks at why and how religions have had such an immense impact on human history and in doing so uncovers the ineradicable connection between politics and religion--a connection which still defines us in our own age.--From publisher description","author":[{"family":"O'Grady","given":"Selina"}],"citation-key":"ogrady_2012_man","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-84354-696-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","note":"OCLC: 793689781","publisher":"Atlantic Books","publisher-place":"London","title":"And man created god: Kings, cults, and conquests at the time of Jesus","title-short":"And man created god","type":"book"},

Within the paradigm of traditional Chinese hermeneutics, intentionality serves as the linchpin of philological methodology. The central argument of the article is that the lexicographic macrostructure and microstructures of the Shuowen are designed to prove that the changes in the writing systems are historically and graphemically observable, and consequently that the original intentions of the sages who used guwen to write the classics are literally recoverable by working backwards through the reforms and changes in writing to a proper understanding of how they classified and used their words in the guwen writing system.

The highest mineral concentration were measured between 57.70–2962.74mg/kg Al, 1160.04–16452.88mg/kg Ca, 44.83–1799.5mg/kg Fe, 3570.73–27669.72mg/kg K, 477.17–4313.59mg/kg Mg, 1102.62–20912.33mg/kg Na, 443.60–9367.80mg/kg P and 7.18–48.36mg/kg Zn. The highest values of Ca, K and P were established in Foeniculum vulgare (bitter fennel) (16452.88mg/kg), Ocimum minumum (basil) (27669.72mg/kg) and F. vulgare (bitter fennel) (9367.80mg/kg), respectively.

While nitrate contents were high in most cases and varied from 12.15mg/kg lime flover (Tilia corata) to 238.85mg/kg myrtle (Myrtus communis), nitrite contents were established between 3.69mg/kg sesame (Sesamum indicum) to 52.70mg/kg basil (Ocimum minumum).

An accomplishment of both great sweep and illuminating detail, The Sea and Civilization is a stunning work of history that reveals in breathtaking depth how people first came into contact with one another by ocean and river, and how goods, languages, religions, and entire cultures spread across and along the world's waterways. Lincoln Paine takes us back to the origins of long-distance migration by sea with our ancestors' first forays from Africa and Eurasia to Australia and the Americas. He demonstrates the critical role of maritime trade to the civilizations of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley. He reacquaints us with the great seafaring cultures of antiquity like those of the Phoenicians and Greeks, as well as those of India, Southeast and East Asia who parlayed their navigational skills, shipbuilding techniques, and commercial acumen to establish vibrant overseas colonies and trade routes in the centuries leading up to the age of European overseas expansion.

  {"id":"papas_2021_sufi","abstract":"\"This volume describes the social and practical aspects of Islamic mysticism (Sufism) across centuries and geographical regions. Its authors seek to transcend ethereal, essentialist and \"spiritualizing\" approaches to Sufism, on the one hand, and purely pragmatic and materialistic explanations of its origins and history, on the other. Covering five topics (Sufism's economy, social role of Sufis, Sufi spaces, politics, and organization), the volume shows that mystics have been active socio-religious agents who could skillfully adjust to the conditions of their time and place, while also managing to forge an alternative way of living, worshiping and thinking. Basing themselves on the most recent research on Sufi institutions, the contributors to this volume substantially expand our understanding of the vicissitudes of Sufism by paying special attention to its organizational and economic dimensions, as well as complex and often ambivalent relations between Sufis and the societies in which they played a wide variety of important and sometimes critical roles.

  {"id":"papelitzky_2020_writing","abstract":"The last century of China’s Ming dynasty (1368–1644) saw many troubles and challenges from abroad. Pirates raided the coast, Europeans challenged the traditional world order of the tribute system, and the everlasting threat from the northern steppe people continued to raise concerns for the state. This climate of uncertainty resulted in many Ming literati discussing foreign countries. During the last decades of the Ming, seven authors wrote monographs that can be considered a form of early Chinese “world history.\" The authors describe the geography, the history, and the political systems of foreign countries and regions ranging from China’s close neighbors Japan and Mongolia to more distant lands such as Mogadishu and Europe. This books by Elke Papelitzky studies each of the seven author’s knowledge and perception of the world and focuses especially on the countries connected with China at the maritime border: Siam, Malacca, and Portugal, combining a close textual and paratextual analysis with a biographical study to understand why the authors wrote the texts the way they did. This is the first comprehensive introduction to these texts contributing to an understanding of late Ming historiography as well as the perception of foreign countries by late Ming scholars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,5]]},"archive":"JSTOR","author":[{"family":"Papelitzky","given":"Elke"}],"citation-key":"papelitzky_2020_writing","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv1453km1","ISBN":"978-3-447-11309-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"Harrassowitz Verlag","title":"Writing world history in late Ming China and the perception of Maritime Asia","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1453km1"},

  {"id":"parti_2021_animosity","abstract":"This pilot study attempts a novel compari­ son on how metaphors of BITTERNESS are used in English and Mandarin Chinese, in or­ der to identify subtle cross­linguistic differ­ ences. Using dictionary definitions and Word­ Net databases, we conduct a lexical semantic analysis and establish the various senses “bit­ ter words” can convey. Then, with the help of corpus data we explore the typical themes and contexts the two languages utilize sensory words related to this concept. We observed that figurative uses of bitter in English tend to revolve around ANIMOSITY, while Chinese 苦 ku3 ‘bitter’ frequently expresses SUFFER­ ING. Due to the displeasing character of this human taste experience, conceptualizations of BITTERNESS are overwhelmingly negative. However, we also found that BITTERNESS does not always transmit negative polarity, ex­ pressions such as “a bitter pill to swallow” and “良藥苦口 good medicine tastes bitter” carry an evaluative positivity. Related to linguistic synaesthesia, we found that bitter in English has origins in the tactile sensory domain, and channels this modality when used as a con­ ceptual metaphor for HARSHNESS, describ­ ing colds and winds, or sometimes words.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Liesenfeld","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"parti_2021_animosity","container-title":"Proceedings of the 35th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation","event-place":"Shanghai/Online","event-title":"PACLIC","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"page":"700-710","publisher":"Association for Computational Linguistics","publisher-place":"Shanghai/Online","source":"Zotero","title":"Animosity and Suffering: Metaphors of BITTERNESS in English and Chinese","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://aclanthology.org/2021.paclic-1.74"},
  {"id":"parti_2022_fragrance","abstract":"Since the legendary “Divine Farmer”, Shennong, and the compendium attributed to him (Shennon Bencao Jing1 神農本草經), Chinese people have strived to collect, describe, and categorize medicinal substances. Throughout the centuries, knowledge of these materials was collated into bencaos – such as the famous Bencao Gangmu (本草綱目) – compendiums containing the many plant-based, animal, and mineral products. Among the thousands of various materials used in Traditional Chinese Medicine however, there are a few special ones that represent exotic, foreign items. Extra-Chinese herbs and plants were systematically recorded as early as the 4th century in the Nanfang Caomu Zhuang2 (南方草木狀) [Plants of the Southern Regions], and many were consequently incorporated not only into the medicine systems, but into culinary traditions as well. Interestingly, many of these items have highly aromatic properties and can be categorized today as culinary spices (ginger, cloves, pepper). and incense (myrrh, frankincense, sandalwood). The history of how and when these exotic elements arrived into TCM has been discussed by other before, including the late botanist Prof. Shiu-Ying Hu.3 In the present study, we expand on this approach and use botanical, historical, philological, and geospatial information to map the exchanges and the approximate trajectories of land and sea routes the products were traded on. We present the results using powerful, interactive visualizations to demonstrate the historical and cultural significance of the arrival (and presence) of these materials into the Chinese medicinal domain.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"parti_2022_fragrance","event-title":"Botanical Symposium 2022: Exploring Innovative Approaches in Chinese Medicines – From Bench to Bedside","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Fragrance from the periphery and beyond: Mapping the origins of foreign spices in Chinese materia medica","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://event.fourwaves.com/botanicalsymposium2022/abstracts/1ea06222-f8a6-400c-8c92-de4e419a56f3"},
  {"id":"parti_2022_naming","abstract":"When investigating the linguistic phenomena around the exchange of words along with items of trade in contact situations, linguists already have a good understanding of how loanwords and Wanderwörter operate. In this talk, I will try to approach the same event – linguistic acculturation, the “response in a language to new items that become known through cultural contact” (Cambell & Mixco, 2007) – but focus on words, specifically the names of novel items, that were not simply borrowed, but otherwise “innovated”. Aromatic substances, such as spices and incense, were frequent and practical products of long-distance trade early on, and thus represent an ideal set of cultural items with corresponding names in various languages. The question then is: How do people name spices, and specifically, new spices that they encounter? And what are the motivations and mechanism of the naming process when adopted by a community? We will see that besides borrowing, the strategies involve innovation using internal resources (compounding, blending), semantic shifts (narrowing, broadening, displacement), and the extensions of meaning by way of metonymy or metaphors. By analyzing hundreds of spice names in English, Chinese, and Arabic, I will introduce the typical structural requirements and salient features that influence the creation of a name and theorize how languages “generate” new names for novel materials based on existing prototypes. I will also discuss the highly sensory nature of these substances (taste, fragrance, colour, etc.), and their effect on the naming process.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"parti_2022_naming","event-place":"Korea/Online","event-title":"The 31st Joint Workshop on Linguistics and Language Processing","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"license":"All rights reserved","publisher-place":"Korea/Online","title":"The Naming Principles of Novel Cultural Items: A Perspective from the Spice Domain","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://jwllp31.github.io/program/"},
  {"id":"parti_2023_mapping","abstract":"The majority of existing literature on spices is found in the areas of gastronomy, botany, and history. This study investigates spices on a linguistic level and aims to be a comprehensive linguistic account on the items of the spice trade. Some of these dried plant matter were highly desired at certain points in history, due to their attractive aroma and medicinal value, thus they were ideal products of trade early on. Cultural contact and exchange, and the introduction of new cultural items begets situations of language contact and linguistic acculturation, and so in the case of spices, we not only have a set of items that traveled around the world, but also a set of names. This domain is very rich in loanwords and Wanderwörter, but also supplies us with a myriad of cases where spice names are conventional innovations. To make it more interesting, the thesis compares English, Arabic, and Chinese, languages that represent major powers in the spice trade at different times. After selecting a set of 24 spices, I have collected data on their names and related etymologies, and introduced 6 of them in detail regarding their identity, botany, history, spread, and names. The thesis has two main parts. Part one represents the geographic and linguistic diffusion of spices and their names. Basically, I track and explain word origins and subsequent spread by tracing the materials and the propagation of the accompanying Wanderwort. This part relies on philological literature, and tools from historical linguistics, such as etymological research, as well as geospatial visualizations. Part two examines the language of spices, referring to the terminology and nomenclature related to the spice domain from linguistic-cognitive perspectives. Focusing on the structure and components of 360 collected spice names, it is a systematic investigation on how humans name spices: what are the mechanism and motivations behind the naming principles, and how this possibly relates to the salient sensory features of the products (strong gustatory, olfactory, or visual stimuli). Conclusions are made on the connections between the physical properties of the spices, their patterns of diffusion, and the prototypical spices and their effect of naming principles. Besides being a novel and original approach to research and categorize spices from a linguistic point of view, this study offers new insights to our knowledge about wandering loanwords, and the effect of the highly sensory nature of spices in the naming process when adopted by a community. It is also intended to be a basis for a useful working database for future research, and aims to dispel some of the chaos and confusion surrounding spice names.","author":[{"family":"Parti","given":"Gábor"}],"citation-key":"parti_2023_mapping","event-place":"Hong Kong","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"English","license":"All rights reserved","number-of-pages":"210","publisher":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","publisher-place":"Hong Kong","title":"Mapping the Language of Spices A Corpus-Based, Philological Study on the Words of the Spice Domain","title-short":"Mapping the Language of Spices","type":"thesis","URL":"https://theses.lib.polyu.edu.hk/handle/200/12389"},

  {"id":"pavoni_2018_taste","abstract":"Taste usually occupies the bottom of the sensorial hierarchy, as the quintessentially hedonistic sense, too close to the animal, the elemental and the corporeal, and for this reason disciplined and moralised. At the same time, taste is indissolubly tied to knowledge. To taste is to discriminate, emit judgement, enter an unstable domain of synaesthetic normativity where the certainty of metaphysical categories begins to crumble. This second title in the ‘Law and the Senses’ series explores law using taste as a conceptual and ontological category able to unsettle legal certainties, and a promising tool whereby to investigate the materiality of law’s relation to the world. For what else is law’s reduction of the world into legal categories, if not law’s ingesting the world by tasting it, and emitting moral and legal judgements accordingly? Through various topics including coffee, wine, craft cider and Japanese knotweed, this volume explores the normativities that shape the way taste is felt and categorised, within and beyond subjective, phenomenological and human dimensions. The result is an original interdisciplinary volume – complete with seven speculative ‘recipes’ – dedicated to a rarely explored intersection, with contributions from artists, legal academics, philosophers, anthropologists and sociologists.","citation-key":"pavoni_2018_taste","editor":[{"family":"Pavoni","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Mandic","given":"Danilo"},{"family":"Nirta","given":"Caterina"},{"family":"Philippopoulos-Mihalopoulos","given":"Andreas"}],"ISBN":"978-1-911534-32-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"University of Westminster Press","title":"Taste","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv5vddz9","volume":"2"},

The hypothesis of a link with Korean pwuche < pwuthye &#x2018;Buddha&#x2019; and of their ultimate origin as deriving from a Chinese rendering of Sanskrit Buddha makes sense from both a linguistic and historical point of view. Still, the last part of the Japanese and Korean forms has no correspondent in Chinese and has remained unaccounted for hitherto. From the comparison with the pattern &#x2018;Buddha-lord&#x2019; for the name of Buddha in several Asian languages, it is hypothesized that the enigmatic final element was originally a word for &#x2018;lord, ruler, king&#x2019;.

We provide experimental evidence that this asymmetry is due to phonetic differences in the realisation of word-final [n] in English and French, and, consequently, to the way in which English and French word-final [n] are perceived by native speakers of Japanese. Specifically, French but not English word-final [n] has a strong vocalic release that Japanese listeners perceive as their native vowel [ui]. We propose a psycholinguistic model in which most loanword adaptations originate in perceptual assimilation, a process which takes place during perception and which maps non-native sounds and sound structures onto the phonetically closest native ones.

  {"id":"peters_2017_bread","abstract":"The purpose of my research is to understand the meaning behind Japanese bread among Japanese people. Although bread is not something native to Japan, the Japanese have for over five hundred years made improvements to bread so it would become palatable to themselves. In the end Japanese people succeeded in creating bread specific to Japan— “Japanese bread”. However, because Japanese bread has been generated specifically for the Japanese, it is not something common in rest of the world. This fact makes it difficult for the Japanese living abroad to obtain Japanese bread amid increasing globalization.    Material collected between February and September 2015 during fieldwork conducted among Japanese people in San Diego, CA, for this study, reveals that most people have begun baking Japanese bread on their own as a result of seeking the bread that can satisfy their appetites. Even though everyone has different motives and goals for bread baking, Japanese women specifically share common features in their baking. Japanese bread baking is not simply for indulging their appetite for Japanese bread but for fulfilling a role as Japanese women. Viewed from the understanding of the traditional notion of “good wives, wise mothers” representing self-sacrifice and devotion to family, Japanese wives and mothers make an effort to learn and bake bread to feed the best food to their families.   A larger aim of this research is to contribute to the field of folklore, especially the study of material culture. The study of foodways and other genres of material culture share the directions and theories of folklore scholarship. Different from other genres of material culture showing the individuals’ identity through subcultural objects, scholars in food studies tend to address staple foods as a source of symbolism in a given culture and the emergence of a cultural identity or a group’s identity through such food. To expand this tradition, I have shown the intimate connection between the Japanese and bread as non-staple food of the Japanese in the individual level by interpreting individuals’ raw voices gathered during fieldwork.","archive":"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I; Publicly Available Content Database","archive_location":"1983520799","author":[{"family":"Peters","given":"Arisa Shibagaki"}],"citation-key":"peters_2017_bread","event-place":"Ann Arbor","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"978-0-355-52124-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"297","publisher":"Indiana University","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor","title":"Bread and Washoku: Unveiling Japanese identity through the necessity of bread baking","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/1983520799?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true"},

The connection between man and his search for drugs in nature dates from the far past, of which there is ample evidence from various sources: written documents, preserved monuments, and even original plant medicines. Awareness of medicinal plants usage is a result of the many years of struggles against illnesses due to which man learned to pursue drugs in barks, seeds, fruit bodies, and other parts of the plants. Contemporary science has acknowledged their active action, and it has included in modern pharmacotherapy a range of drugs of plant origin, known by ancient civilizations and used throughout the millennia. The knowledge of the development of ideas related to the usage of medicinal plants as well as the evolution of awareness has increased the ability of pharmacists and physicians to respond to the challenges that have emerged with the spreading of professional services in facilitation of man's life.","author":[{"family":"Petrovska","given":"Biljana Bauer"}],"citation-key":"petrovska_2012_historical","container-title":"Pharmacognosy Reviews","DOI":"10.4103/0973-7847.95849","ISSN":"0973-7847","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"page":"1-5","title":"Historical Review of Medicinal Plants’ Usage","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},

However, the choice of texts has not been guided by formal criteria alone, but also by considerations regarding content: For the most part, the specimens belong to the narrative genre; they have been taken from narrative literature, from the epics Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana, and from the Purānas.

His voyages began in 1271 with a visit to China, after which he served the Kublai Khan on numerous diplomatic missions.

The plant commodities were divided into two groups: species commodities, such as “cabbages,” that can be attributed to particular species; and general commodities, such as “hydrogenated oils,” whose species composition is not known. A total of 82 species commodities and 28 general commodities contribute 90% of national per capita supplies of food plants. The 82 species commodities consist of 103 species. Fifty‐six of these commodities, comprising 75 species, individually account for 5% or more of at least one county's supply of a nutritional category (plant weight, plant calories, plant protein, plant fag. These figures are several times higher than previous findings that very few (7–30) plant species feed the world. The new figures are considered more accurate because they derive from national supply rather than global production data and from several separate measures of the importance of a food commodity rather than one. The results suggest that (1) plant species diversity remains a significant factor for world food supply; and (2) a conservation priority is to maintain both this wider away of species and the diversity of genetic variants that comprise each species.\n            \n          , \n            \n              Resumen:\n              Los datos de la FAO sobre abastecimiento de ali‐mentos para 146 países, fueron analizados para identifcar la mercaderia vegetal que comprende el 90% tope do abastecimiento per capita de alimentos vegetales en peso, calorías, proteínas y grasas.

  {"id":"qian_2019_reexamining","abstract":"\"For hundreds of years, into the twentieth century, the culture groups in the areas we now know as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam shared a great many political and social values, religious beliefs, and artistic and literary traditions. These common cultural features were recorded and transmitted in the same basic written language-classical or literary Chinese (known as guwen/wenyan in China, Kanbun in Japan, Hanmun in Korea, and Hánvan in Vietnam). The umbrella term for this shared language is \"literary Sinitic\"-a term designed to recognize the fact that although guwen/wenyan originally developed in China, it had a vibrant life of its own in other areas of East Asia (i.e., what this study terms the Sinosphere). This huge but understudied body of written documents offers extraordinarily rich resources for examining issues of cultural continuity and change in this important region of the world. Unfortunately, in the aftermath of the political and social turmoil in East Asia during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, all four cultures abandoned their use of literary Sinitic. As a result, a great many documents written in this important script have been ignored, leaving a substantial gap in our understanding of the relationship between the histories and cultures of premodern East Asia. Like its companion volume, Rethinking the Sinosphere: Poetics, Aesthetics and Identity Formation, this book seeks to fill this gap. One of the primary goals of this study is to break down the intellectual and cultural barriers that have made the Sinosphere difficult to see for itself. These barriers are of two sorts. One is the academic tendency toward intense specialization; most scholars of East Asia focus on a single country, a well-defined period, and an equally well-defined discipline (linguistics, philosophy, history, literature, art, etc.). Another is the tendency of scholars to privilege the country and period they study, and to adhere closely to their disciplinary training and outlook. To break down these barriers, a group of highly accomplished scholars committed to cross-cultural comparisons and interdisciplinary perspectives have been selected for this volume, and the result is a careful and critical examination of the complex cultural interactions that took place in premodern East Asia. Among the many contributions of this study are its examination of different literary genres (including \"classics,\" poetic primers, works for and about women, detective stories, and folksongs), its broad chronological scope (from the eleventh to the twentieth centuries), its equally extensive spatial range (including China, the Xi Xia Kingdom, Japan, Vietnam, and Korea), and its attention to \"minority\" cultures.

The most abundant Turkish linguistic traces have remained along the main strategic lines of Ottoman expansion (Thrace—Macedonia—south Serbia—the Raška region—Bosnia and Herzegovina); migrations of the Serb population contributed to their wide reach by disseminating Turkish loanwords far from central Balkan areas.

Also known as ‘Golden Spice of India’ turmeric has been used in India for medicinal purposes for centuries. It has been used in traditional medicine as a household remedy for various diseases, including biliary disorders, anorexia, cough, diabetic wounds, hepatic disorders, rheumatism and sinusitis. In addition to its use as a spice and pigment, turmeric and its constituents mainly curcumin and essential oils shows a wide spectrum of biological actions. These include its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic, anti-mutagenic, anticoagulant, antifertility, anti-diabetic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiviral, anti-fibrotic, anti-venom, antiulcer, hypotensive and hypocholesteremic activities. Modern interest on turmeric started in 1970's when researchers found that the herb may possess antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Safety evaluation studies indicate that both turmeric and curcumin are well tolerated at a very high dose without any toxic effects. Thus, turmeric and its constituents have the potential for the development of modern medicine for the treatment of various diseases.","author":[{"family":"Rathaur","given":"Preeti"},{"family":"Raja","given":"Waseem"},{"family":"Ramteke","given":"P W"},{"family":"John","given":"Suchit A"}],"citation-key":"rathaur_2012_turmeric","container-title":"Internation Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research","ISSN":"0975-8232","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"1987-1994","source":"Zotero","title":"Turmeric: The golden spice of life","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

  {"id":"reckziegel_2021_visual","abstract":"Abstract\n            Historical maps tell rich stories, and they are also valuable data objects. They vary greatly in size, type, and context, as well as the kinds and density of information they contain. Historical maps are indeed objects that invite close reading, interpretation, and debate. Whereas a variety of environments exist for the annotation, manipulation, and representation of digital maps, or map-derived data, workflows in the spatial digital humanities can be complex and those environments are not often well integrated. In this article, we describe a prototype named ‘MapFolder’ for studying maps, its algorithms for calculating the areal distortion, its visual design for communicating that distortion, along with a scholarly workflow. We blend annotation practices common in the spatial humanities with the workflows of georeferencing in order to be able to visualize how historic cartographic documents compare with the geospatial representations we are familiar with today. The case studies we use to demonstrate ‘MapFolder’ are maps of the medieval period, a body of maps that are less often studied algorithmically and that are usually avoided in typical workflows of georeferencing. MapFolder is by no means a prototype designed to work exclusively with medieval maps, but since maps of this period are only partially geographic in their design, they offer a particularly fruitful opportunity to rethink the algorithmic manipulation of historical depictions of the world. Working with this complex data from the humanities allows us, as well, to propose the use of visualization for critical, comparative spatial analysis in pre-modern studies and beyond.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Reckziegel","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wrisley","given":"David Joseph"},{"family":"Hixson","given":"Taylor Wright"},{"family":"Jänicke","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"reckziegel_2021_visual","container-title":"Digital Scholarship in the Humanities","DOI":"10.1093/llc/fqaa059","ISSN":"2055-7671, 2055-768X","issue":"Supplement_2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,5]]},"language":"en","page":"ii251-ii272","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Visual exploration of historical maps","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/dsh/article/36/Supplement_2/ii251/6263475","volume":"36"},

  {"id":"reed_1995_youyang","abstract":"The Youyang zazu is a ninth century miscellany by Duan Chengshi (c. 800-860) It is a collection of anecdotes, tales, lists and bits of information in which we read of historical people and events, supernatural creatures and events, and the various ways that the realm of the supernatural interacts with that of humans. Chapter one is a brief introduction of Youyang zazu. The first part is a general introduction, and the second part is a discussion of the value of the work. The third part of this chapter is a description of the dissertation project. Chapter two is a study of the textual history of Youyang zazu, and a biographical sketch of Duan Chengshi. Chapter three is a study of the content and the formal characteristics of the Youyang zazu. The work is shown to focus on the three primary themes of everyday life, things foreign and the supernatural. The Youyang zazu is shown in this chapter to be made up of four major types of literature. They are the list, the informative piece, the anecdote and the polished anecdote, or tale. Chapter four of the dissertation consists of fully annotated translations of a selection of one-hundred forty-five entries drawn from the collection. The translations are grouped on the basis of formal characteristics. Chapter five is a study and analysis of two of the juan (chapters) of the Youyang zazu. The first part of the chapter focuses on the unusual name shared by these juan and the second part is an analysis of their content, themes and formal characteristics. Chapter six is a fully annotated translation of juan fourteen and fifteen, the two \"Nuogao ji.\" Chapter seven is a discussion of traditional and modern bibliographical treatment of this work. It is shown that not one of the generic labels associated with the Youyang zazu is appropriate as they are defined too narrowly to fit a work as diverse as the Youyang zazu. The second part of this chapter is a discussion of authorial intent.","archive":"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I","archive_location":"304240545","author":[{"family":"Reed","given":"Carrie Elizabeth"}],"citation-key":"reed_1995_youyang","event-place":"Ann Arbor","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["1995"]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"584","publisher":"University of Washington","publisher-place":"Ann Arbor","title":"\"Youyang zazu\": Miscellaneous morsels from Youyang","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/openview/037b01e4dfcf413150c5f94e87d6509f/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y"},

  {"id":"reed_2010_genetics","abstract":"Eating is dangerous. While food contains nutrients and calories that animals need to produce heat and energy, it may also contain harmful parasites, bacteria, or chemicals. To guide food selection, the senses of taste and smell have evolved to alert us to the bitter taste of poisons and the sour taste and off-putting smell of spoiled foods. These sensory systems help people and animals to eat defensively, and they provide the brake that helps them avoid ingesting foods that are harmful. But choices about which foods to eat are motivated by more than avoiding the bad; they are also motivated by seeking the good, such as fat and sugar. However, just as not everyone is equally capable of sensing toxins in food, not everyone is equally enthusiastic about consuming high-fat, high-sugar foods. Genetic studies in humans and experimental animals strongly suggest that the liking of sugar and fat is influenced by genotype; likewise, the abilities to detect bitterness and the malodors of rotting food are highly variable among individuals. Understanding the exact genes and genetic differences that affect food intake may provide important clues in obesity treatment by allowing caregivers to tailor dietary recommendations to the chemosensory landscape of each person.","author":[{"family":"Reed","given":"Danielle Renee"},{"family":"Knaapila","given":"Antti"}],"citation-key":"reed_2010_genetics","container-title":"Progress in molecular biology and translational science","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-375003-7.00008-X","ISSN":"1878-0814 1877-1173","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"213-240","title":"Genetics of Taste and Smell: Poisons and Pleasures","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21036327 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3342754/","volume":"94"},

Manila emerged as one of the greatest and wealthiest entrepoˆts in Southeast Asia, rivaling the Dutch city of Batavia in Indonesia and dominating commerce with America and Europe in both silk and spices. Manila became a magnet to trading ships from China, Japan, Maluku, Malacca, Siam, Cambodia, and Borneo, which arrived laden with an astonishing abundance of luxurious goods. The trade ﬂows of silver and precious Asian merchandise—the bales of Chinese silks, the porcelain, Indian textiles, spices, local wax, honey, and forest products—and the shifting and hybrid populations that supplied labor and diverse expertise lent the city its own special character and texture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reyes","given":"Raquel A.

As a community of ethnic Tibetans in Nepal, crossing the border has slowly resulted in a shift of focus towards Kathmandu in many ways. Changing attitudes and evolving social practices are resulting in a marked shift in language use in the younger generations. Superf icially, the Nubri language appears quite vital within the valley. However, I show how an examination of different borders in the sociolinguistic landscape helps leads us to a much clearer understanding of the actual linguistic vitality, revealing a serious threat to its continued survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,9]]},"citation-key":"roche_2022_bordering","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv2wr4xcd","editor":[{"family":"Roche","given":"Gerald"},{"family":"Hyslop","given":"Gwendolyn"}],"ISBN":"978-90-485-5271-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Amsterdam University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bordering Tibetan languages: Making and marking languages in transnational high asia","title-short":"Bordering tibetan languages","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/j.ctv2wr4xcd"},

In the first part of the book, the author formulates an epistemological thesis according to which the \"virtual never ended.\" Although the frontiers between the real and the virtual are certainly more porous today, they still exist and endure. In the book's second part, the author offers an ontological reflection on emerging digital technologies as \"imaginative machines.\" He introduces the concept of emagination, arguing that human schematizations are always externalized into technologies, and that human imagination has its analog in the digital dynamics of articulation between databases and algorithms. The author takes an ethical and political stance in the concluding chapter. He resorts to the notion of \"digital habitus\" for claiming that within the digital we are repeatedly being reconducted to an oversimplified image and understanding of ourselves.

  {"id":"ronga_2012_linguistic","abstract":"Recent studies on cortical processing of sensory information highlight the importance of multisensory integration, and define precise rules governing reciprocal influences between inputs of different sensory modalities. We propose that psychophysical interactions between different types of sensory stimuli and linguistic synaesthesia share common origins and mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we compare neurophysiological findings with corpus-based analyses relating to linguistic synaesthesia. Namely, we present Williams’ hypothesis and its recent developments about the hierarchy of synaesthetic pairings, and examine critical aspects of this theory concerning universality, directionality, sensory categories, and usage of corpora. These theoretical issues are verified against linguistic data derived from corpus-based analyses of Italian synaesthetic pairings related to auditory and tactile modalities. Our findings reveal a strong parallel between linguistic synaesthesia and neurophysiological interactions between different sensory stimuli, suggesting that linguistic synaesthesia is affected by tendencies similar to the rules underlying the perceptual association of distinct sensory modalities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ronga","given":"Irene"},{"family":"Bazzanella","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Rossi","given":"Ferdinando"},{"family":"Iannetti","given":"Giandomenico"}],"citation-key":"ronga_2012_linguistic","container-title":"Pragmatics & Cognition","container-title-short":"P&C","DOI":"10.1075/pc.20.1.06ron","ISSN":"0929-0907, 1569-9943","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",5,24]]},"language":"en","page":"135-167","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Linguistic synaesthesia, perceptual synaesthesia, and the interaction between multiple sensory modalities","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/pc.20.1.06ron","volume":"20"},

  {"id":"ruzak_2021_storytelling","abstract":"Previous analyses of late medieval writing produced in Western Europe and its relationship to the East have been largely occupied by studies concerning the monstrous. Said studies dealt with how the West depicted the people of the East as “Other” and grotesque due to religious and cultural prejudice. This thesis instead looks at the othering and exoticization of the East through the use of spices as narrative symbols. By examining English-language texts written in Europe between 1250 and 1500C.E., this thesis determines the effect of spices in a narrative context through two lenses: danger and wealth. In both instances, the economic and cultural environment of Europe—i.e., the demand for exotic spices and their view of the East as Other—contributed to stories of dangerous beasts and valuable spices. These stories exemplified the reciprocal relationship of collective cultural tradition and storytelling as they influenced both each other and the everyday lives of medieval Europeans.","author":[{"family":"Ruzak","given":"Madeline E."}],"citation-key":"ruzak_2021_storytelling","genre":"M.A.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Oregon","source":"Zotero","title":"Storytelling through spices: The other and the East in late medieval narratives","type":"thesis"},

  {"id":"saldanha_2011_itinerariesa","abstract":"[Jan Huygen van Linschoten's 1596 \"Itinerario\", published in Amsterdam just before Dutch world hegemony, opened the Indian Ocean world for the European geographical imagination, especially regarding its spice markets and non-Christian cultures. Linschoten confirmed rumors in Europe that the Portuguese Estado da Índia had become decadent and unstable, especially in its capital Goa. He also mentioned the absence of Portuguese control in the market of Bantam, which would become the capital of Dutch Indonesia. In addition, the book disclosed nautical and economic information about the Indian Ocean until then carefully guarded by the Portuguese, especially about the Spice Islands. In fact, the book's navigational section was published early so it could be on board the so-called First Voyage organized by the Dutch. This article discusses the main features that made the cartographic, cultural, and economic information of the \"Itinerario\" crucial to this historical expedition. Historicizing the discipline of geography is indispensable for understanding how travel and technology affect what can be known of the planet. Following Foucault's understanding of the production of knowledge, the central argument is that the \"Itinerario\" inaugurated a leap in the Dutch geographical \"episteme\" and a new struggle for the Indian Ocean. Linschoten's humanist scholarship was from the start a multiplicity of knowledges and voices that could be read and used in many ways. ᖖ年，在荷兰建立世界霸权之前，林斯豪滕（ Jan Huygen van Linschoten ）的航海旅行记在阿姆斯特丹出版，该书向欧洲的地理界开启了印度洋世界，特别是有关香料市场和非基督教文化的部分。林斯豪滕证实了在欧洲的传言，即葡萄牙的埃斯塔达印度已经变得腐朽和不稳定，尤其在其首都果阿。他还提到了葡萄牙对万丹市场的缺乏控制，该地区后来成了荷属印度尼西亚的首都。此外，书中还披露了有关印度洋的航海和经济信息，在此之前，这些信息一直被葡萄牙人小心地守护着，尤其是关于香料群岛的信息。事实上，本书的航海章节是提前出版的，为的是赶上由荷兰组织的所谓首航。本文讨论了该航海旅行记在制图学，文化和经济信息方面的主要特点，这些信息对这次历史性的探险是至关重要的。为了理解旅行和技术是如何影响我们认识所在的星球，对地理学科的历史化了解是必不可少的。基于福柯的关于知识产生的认识，本文的中心论点是，林斯豪滕的航海旅行记开创了荷兰地理“知识”的飞跃，并且开启了新一轮对印度洋的争斗。林斯豪滕的人文主义奖学金从一开始就是一个知识和观点的多重体，可以在多方面加以解读和使用。 El \"Itinerario\" de JanHuygen van Linschoten de 1596, publicado en Amsterdam poco antes de la hegemonía holandesa global, abrió el mundo del Océano Índico a la imaginación geográfica de los europeos, en especial lo tocante a sus mercados de especias y culturas no cristianas. Linschoten confirmó los rumores que circulaban en Europa de que el Estado da Índia portugués se había tornado decadente e inestable, especialmente su capital Goa. Él también mencionó la ausencia de control portgugués sobre el mercado de Bantam, que llegaría a ser la capital de la Indonesia holandesa. Además, el libro reveló información náutica y económica sobre el Océano Índico, hasta entonces cuidadosamente ocultada por los portugueses, en particular la relacionada con las Islas de la Especiería. En efecto, la sección del libro sobre navegación se publicó primero, de suerte que pudiese estar a bordo del llamado Primer Viaje organizado por los holandeses. En este artículo se discuten los rasgos principales que convirtieron en crucial la información carográfica, cultural y económica del \"Itinerario\" para esta histórica expedición. Historiar la disciplina geográfica es indispensable para entender cómo el viaje y la ecnología afectan lo que se pueda conocer del planeta. Siguiendo el pensamiento de Foucault sobre la producción de conocimiento, el argumento central que se presenta aquí es que el \"Itinerario\" inauguró un salto en el \"episteme\" geográfico holandés y una nueva contienda por el Océano Índico.

  {"id":"salerno_2022_venice","abstract":"This paper examines the ongoing transition of Venice towards a shortterm city, posited as an urban form which accommodates the dwelling practices of temporary populations as tourists, at the expenses of a stable resident population. This shift is approached through the conceptual framework of resilience, which is also explored in its political and discursive dimensions. At the base of the emergence of a short-term city, we analyse the redistributive impacts of short-term rentals mediated by digital platforms and their influence on the housing market, but also the related entrenchments of a local policy agenda supporting the resilience of the industry itself above that of the city as a living organism. After illustrating the development of the hospitality sector in the city fabric over the last four decades and presenting the historical challenges that Venice has been facing in regard to its capacity to retain a stable population, we seek to unravel the debate on ‘the future of Venice’, which confronts local and global agents defending a ‘conservationist’ approach for Venice as an ineluctably tourist city, with social actors who claim for the defence of residence – and therefore for a ban on STR – as a necessary condition for a socially resilient alternative.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Salerno","given":"Giacomo-Maria"},{"family":"Russo","given":"Antonio Paolo"}],"citation-key":"salerno_2022_venice","container-title":"Journal of Sustainable Tourism","container-title-short":"Journal of Sustainable Tourism","DOI":"10.1080/09669582.2020.1860068","ISSN":"0966-9582, 1747-7646","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,4]]},"language":"en","page":"1040-1059","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Venice as a short-term city: Between global trends and local lock-ins","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09669582.2020.1860068","volume":"30"},

  {"id":"salloum_2018_scent","abstract":"\"The traditions of Syrian cooking go back hundreds of years, and is notable for its sensory components, in which aroma and texture are as important as taste and nutrition. Over the centuries, the unique dishes of Greater Syria (bilaad al-shaam) were preserved by those who cooked them. For cooks in imperial households, family homes, or on simple peasant farms, recipes were handed down from generation to generation. Despite centuries of occupation, unrest, economic hardships, and political strife, the people of Greater Syria continued to cook their burghul, lentil, chickpeas, kishk, and yogurt dishes as if life around them never changed. Syrian-born Habeeb Salloum and his daughters Leila Salloum Elias and Muna Salloum have researched and explored the far reaches of Syrian cuisine for many years (and in Habeeb's case, decades). Their resulting cookbook, Pomegranate and Rose Water, provides a succinct window into the dining tables of eighteenth and nineteenth-century Syria, featuring many delectable, heart-healthy recipes that have never before been published in English. The book also provides a poignant window into Syrian culture and everyday life then and now-bound together by ageless and truly beautiful food traditions.

  {"id":"salonia_2021_dissenting","abstract":"Giovanni da Empoli’s second voyage to Asia (1510–1514) was eventful and violent, characterised by the emergence of conﬂicting agendas among different groups of Portuguese. The Florentine merchant’s long letter about the voyage is an extraordinary document, and provides insights in three important areas. First, it allows us to ﬁll some of the gaps in the history of the early phases of Portuguese empire building, questioning the extent to which the Crown was pursuing a clear and coherent strategy that included the conquest of Malacca. Second, it problematises further our conception of “the Portuguese” by reporting episodes of Portuguese-on-Portuguese violence and opposing views on the objectives of Portuguese ﬂeets in the Indian Ocean. Finally, Giovanni unequivocally expresses admiration for the international markets of Eastern city-ports and openly criticises the militarist attitude and lawless tactics of the Portuguese viceroy, Alfonso de Albuquerque, thereby inviting us to reconsider the chronology of a “cosmopolitan reaction” among Italian writers visiting South Asia.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Salonia","given":"Matteo"}],"citation-key":"salonia_2021_dissenting","container-title":"Itinerario","container-title-short":"Itinerario","DOI":"10.1017/S0165115321000176","ISSN":"0165-1153, 2041-2827","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8]]},"language":"en","page":"189-207","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A dissenting voice: the clash of trade and warfare in Giovanni da Empoli's account of his second voyage to Portuguese Asia","title-short":"A dissenting voice","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0165115321000176/type/journal_article","volume":"45"},

This collection of essays demonstrates how the heritagization of the past has played a vital role in processes and strategies related to the making of socio-cultural identities, the establishing of political legitimacies, and the pursuit of economic and geopolitical gains. The contributions range from those dealing with the impact of UNESCO's World Heritage Convention in the Indian Ocean world as a whole to those that address the politics of cultural heritage in various distinct maritime sites such as Zanzibar, Mayotte, Cape Town, the Maldives, Calcutta and Penang. Also examined are the Maritime Silk Road and the Project Mausam initiatives of the Chinese and Indian governments respectively.

The article focuses on the principles and methods of the Dutch behind the expansion process, looking at structural differences as well as similarities of both companies. Although the two organizations were born out of the same anti-Spanish sentiment, the paper argues that the companies differed widely in their aggressiveness, commercial behaviour, financing, and colonial concepts, according to the territory they claimed.

As such, it constitutes a milestone in research on the evolution of the Sinitic language group. Whereas previous studies have emphasized the structure of the Chinese characters, this pathbreaking dictionary places primary emphasis on the sounds and meanings of Sinitic roots. Based on more than three decades of intensive investigation in primary and secondary sources, this completely new dictionary places Old Chinese squarely within the Sino-Tibetan language family (including close consideration of numerous Tiberto-Burman languages), while paying due regard to other language families such as Austroasiatic, Miao-Yao (Hmong-Mien), and Kam-Tai.\" \"Designed for use by nonspecialists and specialists alike, the dictionary is highly accessible, being arranged in alphabetical order and possessed of numerous innovative lexicographical features. Each entry offers one or more possible etymologies as well as reconstructed pronunciations and other relevant data. Words that are morphologically related are grouped together into \"word families\" that attempt to make explicit the derivational or other etymological processes that relate them. The dictionary is preceded by a substantive and significant introduction that outlines the author's views on the linguistic position of Chinese within Asia and details the phonological and morphological properties, to the degree they are known, of the earliest stages of the Chinese language and its ancestor. This introduction, because it both summaries and synthesizes earlier work and makes several original contributions, functions as a useful reference work all on its own.\"–Jacket.","author":[{"family":"Schuessler","given":"Axel"}],"citation-key":"schuessler_2007_abc","event-place":"Honolulu","ISBN":"978-0-8248-2975-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"publisher":"University of Hawai'i Press","publisher-place":"Honolulu","title":"ABC etymological dictionary of Old Chinese","type":"book"},

  {"id":"sen_2014_maritime","abstract":"The maritime regions of Southeast Asia played an important but varying role in connecting South Asia and China prior to the sixteenth century. With regard to commercial exchanges, traders, ships, and polities in Southeast Asia facilitated and sometimes controlled the ﬂow of goods. Additionally, merchant associations from South Asia and China established their bases in Southeast Asia to participate in trading activities in the Bay of Bengal and South China Sea regions. At least three distinct networks emerged as a result of these maritime interactions: 1) networks of exchanges among the polities skirting the Bay of Bengal; 2) networks that connected the areas around the South China Sea; and 3) networks of direct exchanges between South Asia and China. Buddhist ideas also circulated through these networks, but seem to have made limited inroads in the maritime regions of Southeast Asia prior to the ﬁfth century AD. By this time, Buddhism had already spread widely in China, with signiﬁcant number of Buddhist missionaries arriving in the region through the maritime routes. Rather than playing a staging role in the transmission of Buddhism to China, the doctrine may have penetrated maritime Southeast Asia due to the vibrant Buddhist interactions and a signiﬁcant increase in commercial activity along the networks linking South Asia and China during the fourth and ﬁfth centuries. The use of Buddhism to legitimise new regimes in China and the diplomatic exchanges between Southeast Asian polities and these courts may have also facilitated the spread of Buddhism in the region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"Tansen"}],"citation-key":"sen_2014_maritime","container-title":"TRaNS: Trans-Regional and -National Studies of Southeast Asia","container-title-short":"TRaNS","DOI":"10.1017/trn.2013.15","ISSN":"2051-364X, 2051-3658","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1]]},"language":"en","page":"31-59","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Maritime Southeast Asia Between South Asia and China to the Sixteenth Century","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S2051364X1300015X/type/journal_article","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"sen_2019_zheng","abstract":"By examining the activities of Zheng He and members of his expeditions at the Malabar Coast, Sri Lanka, and Bengal, this article argues that the Yongle emperor wanted to exert military power in South Asia in order to legitimize his usurpation at the Ming court. The essay analyzes Zheng He’s intervention in the dispute between Calicut and Cochin, the armed conflict in Sri Lanka in 1410-11, and the expedition’s involvement in a dispute between Bengal and its neighboring polity, Jaunpur. These episodes in South Asia make it difficult to accept the modern representations of the Zheng He expeditions as diplomatic missions intended to promote peace and harmony. Rather, they were, as the essay contends, part of the Yongle emperor’s aim to establish hegemony over “all the known world under the Heaven” or the tianxia.","author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"Tansen"}],"citation-key":"sen_2019_zheng","container-title":"china and asia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Zheng He’s Military Interventions in South Asia","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"sen_2023_inventing","abstract":"Although inspired by the nineteenth-century term ‘Silk Road(s)’, the phrase ‘Maritime Silk Road’ has its own origins, connotations, and applications. This article examines the emergence of the latter term as a China-centric concept and its various entanglements since the early 1980s, involving the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) political bodies, academia, the ‘open door’ policy, the pursuit of World Heritage listings, and the current ‘Belt and Road Initiative’. These entanglements, the article contends, have resulted in the emergence of what could be called a ‘Maritime Silk Road’ ecosystem in the PRC. The analysis of this ecosystem presented in the article reveals not only the processes through which a narrative on China’s engagement with the maritime world has been constructed over time, but also its association with issues of national pride, heritage- and tradition-making, foreign-policy objectives, and claims to territorial sovereignty. As such, the ‘Maritime Silk Road’ must be understood as a concept that is intimately entwined with the recent history of the PRC and distinct from its nineteenth-century antecedent, which was used as a label for overland connectivity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Sen","given":"Tansen"}],"citation-key":"sen_2023_inventing","container-title":"Modern Asian Studies","container-title-short":"Mod.

However, it would take another ten centuries for cookery books to be produced in the European continent. For centuries to come, gastronomic writing would remain the sole preserve of the Arab-Muslim world, with cooking manuals and recipe books being produced from Baghdad, Aleppo and Egypt in the East, to Muslim Spain, Morocco and Tunisia in the West. A total of nine complete cookery books have survived from this time, containing a total of nearly four thousand recipes. The Sultan's Feast by the Egyptian Ibn Mubarak Shah in the fifteenth century is one such book. Reflecting the importance of gastronomy in Arab culture, this culinary treatise features more than 330 recipes, from bread-making and omelettes, to sweets, pickling and aromatics, and tips on a range of topics, from essentials a cook should know to how to distil drinkable water.

  {"id":"shahani_2020_tasting","abstract":"Tasting Difference examines early modern discourses of racial, cultural, and religious difference that emerged in the wake of contact with foreign peoples and foreign foods from across the globe. Gitanjali Shahani reimagines the contact zone between Western Europe and the global South in culinary terms, emphasizing the gut rather than the gaze in colonial encounters. From household manuals that instructed English housewives how to use newly imported foodstuffs to \"the spicèd Indian air\" of A Midsummer Night's Dream, from the repurposing of Othello as an early modern pitchman for coffee in ballads to the performance of disgust in travel narratives, Shahani shows how early modern genres negotiated the allure and danger of foreign tastes. Turning maxims such as \"We are what we eat\" on their head, Shahani asks how did<em>we</em> (the colonized subjects) become what you (the colonizing subjects) eat? How did we become alternately the object of fear and appetite, loathing and craving? Shahani takes us back several centuries to the process by which food came to be inscribed with racial character and the racial other came to be marked as edible, showing how the racializing of food began in an era well before chicken tikka masala and Balti cuisine. Bringing into conversation critical paradigms in early modern studies, food studies, and postcolonial studies, she argues that it is in the writing on food and eating that we see among the earliest configurations of racial difference, and it is experienced both as a different taste and as a taste of difference.","author":[{"family":"Shahani","given":"Gitanjali G."}],"citation-key":"shahani_2020_tasting","DOI":"10.7591/j.ctvq2w3d4","event-place":"Ithaca","ISBN":"978-1-5017-4871-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"Cornell University Press","publisher-place":"Ithaca","title":"Tasting difference: Food, race, and cultural encounters in early modern literature","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7591/j.ctvq2w3d4"},

The suitability of ecological configuration and meteorological behaviour, the Indian diaspora have carried it forward not only to support her cultural tradition but also to meet up both therapeutic and culinary requirements of spices. From mythology to history, from history to the modern political economy, spices have got a beautiful and aromatic continuity across nations and cultures. The quality of food and its palatability, the nutritive value of food and its therapeutics are nicely contributed by spices. The geospatial distribution in India encompasses hill terrains to rain forest, coastal ecosystem to semi-arid agro-ecology, moist forest ecosystem to rice-based agro-ecosystem in alluvial lands. Spices have got a well-pervading role for integrating ecological diversity and cultural mellifluence.

The present article introduces a cognitive account regarding the directionality of the mapping in poetic discourse. Firstly, we suggest that mapping from lower modalities onto higher ones (e.g. from 'touch' onto 'sight') is more frequently used in poetic discourse than the opposite mapping (i.e. from higher to lower modalities). The findings of a textual analysis of a large-scale poetic corpus are introduced, which support this proposal, and reveal that the 'low to high' mapping is more frequently used than its inverse, and that this tendency is a universal one (across national boundaries and historical periods).Secondly, we propose a cognitive account for this universal tendency according to which the 'low to high' mapping conforms to (while its inverse violates) the following cognitive constraint: mapping from a more accessible concept onto a less accessible one is more natural than its inverse. The findings of an interpretation experiment are introduced, which provide some support for this account by suggesting that the more frequently used structure (i.e. the mapping from the more accessible to the less accessible sense) is easier to comprehend than its inverse.We conclude by proposing that aspects of poetic language are themselves constrained by general cognitive constraints.","author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Yeshayahu"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Michal"}],"citation-key":"shen_1998_how","container-title":"Language and Literature","container-title-short":"Language and Literature","DOI":"10.1177/096394709800700202","ISSN":"0963-9470","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998"]]},"language":"en","page":"123-140","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"How Come Silence Is Sweet but Sweetness Is Not Silent: a Cognitive Account of Directionality in Poetic Synaesthesia","title-short":"How come silence is sweet but sweetness is not silent","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/096394709800700202","volume":"7"},

This robust pattern was found across discourse types (poetic and non-poetic discourse), language boundaries (e.g., English, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese), and historical periods. A cognitive account of this pattern was introduced, according to which this lower-to-higher mapping reflects a cognitively simpler and more basic directionality than the inverse one. Several predictions that follow from this account were tested, using various psychological measures (interpretation generation, recall, difficulty in context generation, and naturalness judgments), and various linguistic forms (nounadjective constructions, and verb phrases with two conjoined modifying adjectives). In accordance with the present account, it was found that the lower-to-higher structure is easier to assign a meaning to, is judged as more natural than its inverse, is better recalled and is judged as easier to construct a context for. Furthermore, sentence ordering is judged as more natural when lower sensory adjectives precede higher ones than in the opposite ordering.","author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Yeshayahu"},{"family":"Aisenman","given":"Ravid"}],"citation-key":"shen_2008_heard","container-title":"Language and Literature","container-title-short":"Language and Literature","DOI":"10.1177/0963947007088222","ISSN":"0963-9470","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"107-121","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter': Synaesthetic metaphors and cognition","title-short":"`Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard are sweeter'","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963947007088222","volume":"17"},

  {"id":"shi_2015_influence","abstract":"Over the millennia after the Eastern Han Dynasty, the introduction of Buddhism into China and the translation of Buddhist scriptures resulted in intense language contact between Sanskrit and Chinese, which have greatly influenced the Chinese language in three ways. First, an unprecedentedly large number of loanwords derived from Sanskrit were borrowed into the Chinese language. They were employed not only in religious contexts but also in the daily language of the common people. Second, new linguistic structures emerged in the course of translating Sanskrit texts into Chinese. This produced a long-lasting effect on the evolution of the Chinese grammar and the formation of Early Modern Chinese. Third, the study of Sanskrit promoted the study of Chinese phonology; most prominently, siddham led to the emergence of dengyunxue等韵学, and the systematic research of Chinese initials, finals and tones.","author":[{"family":"Shi","given":"Xiangdong"}],"citation-key":"shi_2015_influence","collection-title":"Oxford Handbooks","container-title":"The Oxford Handbook of Chinese Linguistics","DOI":"10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199856336.013.0069","ISBN":"0-19-985633-8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"publisher":"Oxford University Press","title":"The Influence of Buddhist Sanskrit on Chinese","type":"chapter"},

  {"id":"sidhu_2014_effects","abstract":"Research examining semantic richness effects in visual word recognition has shown that multiple dimensions of meaning are activated in the process of word recognition (e.g., Yap et al., 2012). This research has, however, been limited to nouns. In the present research we extended the semantic richness approach to verb stimuli in order to investigate how verb meanings are represented. We characterized a dimension of relative embodiment for verbs, based on the bodily sense described by Borghi and Cimatti (2010), and collected ratings on that dimension for 687 English verbs. The relative embodiment ratings revealed that bodily experience was judged to be more important to the meanings of some verbs (e.g., dance, breathe) than to others (e.g., evaporate, expect). We then tested the effects of relative embodiment and imageability on verb processing in lexical decision (Experiment 1), action picture naming (Experiment 2), and syntactic classiﬁcation (Experiment 3). In all three experiments results showed facilitatory effects of relative embodiment, but not imageability: latencies were faster for relatively more embodied verbs, even after several other lexical variables were controlled. The results suggest that relative embodiment is an important aspect of verb meaning, and that the semantic richness approach holds promise as a strategy for investigating other aspects of verb meaning.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Sidhu","given":"David M."},{"family":"Kwan","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Pexman","given":"Penny M."},{"family":"Siakaluk","given":"Paul D."}],"citation-key":"sidhu_2014_effects","container-title":"Acta Psychologica","container-title-short":"Acta Psychologica","DOI":"10.1016/j.actpsy.2014.02.009","ISSN":"00016918","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"language":"en","page":"32-39","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effects of relative embodiment in lexical and semantic processing of verbs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0001691814000614","volume":"149"},

  {"id":"smith_2019_entangled","abstract":"Trade flowed across Eurasia, around the Indian Ocean, and over the Mediterranean for millennia, but in the early modern period, larger parts of the globe became connected through these established trade routes. Knowledge, embodied in various people, materials, texts, objects, and practices, also moved and came together along these routes in hubs of exchange where different social and cultural groups intersected and interacted. <em>Entangled Itineraries</em> traces this movement of knowledge across the Eurasian continent from the early years of the Common Era to the nineteenth century, following local goods, techniques, tools, and writings as they traveled and transformed into new material and intellectual objects and ways of knowing. Focusing on nonlinear trajectories of knowledge in motion, this volume follows itineraries that weaved in and out of busy, crowded cosmopolitan cities in China; in the trade hubs of Kucha and Malacca; and in centers of Arabic scholarship, such as Reyy and Baghdad, which resonated in Bursa, Assam, and even as far as southern France.

The story begins with the aromatic juniper berry originally used by the Dutch to flavour the whisky-like genever. The drink then made its way to Britain, where cheap imitations laced with turpentine and other caustic fillers made it the drink of choice for poor eighteenth-century Londoners. Eventually replaced by the sweetened Old Tom style and then by London Dry, gin was introduced to the wider world by means of the British Empire, and during the Jazz Age became a mainstay of a new drinking culture: the cocktail. Today classic cocktails like the Gimlet and the Negroni are embraced by drinkers who enjoy a new breed of modern gins, and gin has reclaimed pride of place in the world of mixology.

The lemon travelled with Arabs along ancient trade routes, came of age in Sicily and Italy, and sailed to the New World with Columbus. It was an exotic luxury in seventeenth-century Europe and later went on to save the lives of thousands of sailors in the British Royal Navy after being recognized as a cure for scurvy.

  {"id":"sood_2020_asafoetida","abstract":"Asafoetida (Ferula asafoetida) also known as heeng, Devil’s drug, ferula, food of Gods, incense of Devil, stinking gum is an important spice crop belonging to family Apiaceae. It is native to Iran and Afghanistan. Its dried latex (gum oleoresin) is generally used for flavouring curries, sauces, and pickles. Therapeutically, it stimulates the intestinal and respiratory tracts as well as the nervous system. It is beneficial in asthma, whooping cough, and chronic bronchitis. Its essential oil is also used in medicines, food and cosmetic industries. Besides, it is also used as an alternative for pesticides in organic farming. The major constituents of asafoetida are the resin (40–64%), gum (25%) and essential oil (10–17%). The butyl propenyl disulphide is responsible for the aroma of asafoetida. The asaresinotannol is the major constituent present in the resin. It can be grown on unproductive cold deserts of dry temperate areas of Himalayas. It is mainly propagated by seeds. The seeds are sown either in winters or spring. It becomes ready for harvesting after 5 years of planting and yields around 900g per plant. The oleo gum resin and essential oil derived from this plant are sold at premium prices in the international market.

  {"id":"speed_2023_odor","abstract":"Odor and color are strongly associated. Numerous studies demonstrate consistent odor-color associations, as well as effects of color on odor perception and language. Yet, we know little about how these associations arise. Here, we test whether language is a possible mediator of odor-color associations, speciﬁcally whether odor-color associations are mediated by implicit odor naming. In two experiments, we used an interference paradigm to prevent the verbalization of odors during an odor-color matching task. If participants generate color associations subsequent to labeling an odor, interfering with verbalization during the task should affect the ability to make color associations. In Experiment 1, contrary to our hypothesis, verbal interference did not affect odor-color matches. However, since performance accuracy on the verbal interference task was high, it is possible our task did not sufﬁciently disrupt verbal processing. In Experiment 2, we, therefore, used an active verbal interference task, and still found no difference across interference conditions. Odor naming accuracy, odor familiarity, and odor pleasantness, however, did predict odor-color matches. This suggests that although color associations are related to semantic factors, they are not generated by recruiting odor labels in the moment. Overall, our results do not provide evidence that language plays an online role in odor-color associations, instead, they are consistent with the claim that language may have shaped associations during development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Speed","given":"Laura J."},{"family":"De Valk","given":"Josje"},{"family":"Croijmans","given":"Ilja"},{"family":"Huisman","given":"John L.

From almonds and apples to tea and rice, many foods that we consume today have histories that can be traced out of prehistoric Central Asia along the tracks of the Silk Road to kitchens in Europe, America, China, and elsewhere in East Asia. The exchange of goods, ideas, cultural practices, and genes along these ancient routes extends back five thousand years, and organized trade along the Silk Road dates to at least Han Dynasty China in the second century BC. Balancing a broad array of archaeological, botanical, and historical evidence,<em>Fruit from the Sands</em> presents the fascinating story of the origins and spread of agriculture across Inner Asia and into Europe and East Asia. Through the preserved remains of plants found in archaeological sites, Robert N.

  {"id":"srinivasan_2007_black","abstract":"Black pepper (Piper nigrum) is one of the most widely used among spices. It is valued for its distinct biting quality attributed to the alkaloid, piperine. Black pepper is used not only in human dietaries but also for a variety of other purposes such as medicinal, as a preservative, and in perfumery. Many physiological effects of black pepper, its extracts, or its major active principle, piperine, have been reported in recent decades. Dietary piperine, by favorably stimulating the digestive enzymes of pancreas, enhances the digestive capacity and signiﬁcantly reduces the gastrointestinal food transit time. Piperine has been demonstrated in in vitro studies to protect against oxidative damage by inhibiting or quenching free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Black pepper or piperine treatment has also been evidenced to lower lipid peroxidation in vivo and beneﬁcially inﬂuence cellular thiol status, antioxidant molecules and antioxidant enzymes in a number of experimental situations of oxidative stress. The most far-reaching attribute of piperine has been its inhibitory inﬂuence on enzymatic drug biotransforming reactions in the liver. It strongly inhibits hepatic and intestinal aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and UDP-glucuronyl transferase. Piperine has been documented to enhance the bioavailability of a number of therapeutic drugs as well as phytochemicals by this very property. Piperine’s bioavailability enhancing property is also partly attributed to increased absorption as a result of its effect on the ultrastructure of intestinal brush border. Although initially there were a few controversial reports regarding its safety as a food additive, such evidence has been questionable, and later studies have established the safety of black pepper or its active principle, piperine, in several animal studies. Piperine, while it is non-genotoxic, has in fact been found to possess anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor inﬂuences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"srinivasan_2007_black","container-title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","container-title-short":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/10408390601062054","ISSN":"1040-8398, 1549-7852","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,25]]},"language":"en","page":"735-748","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Black Pepper and its Pungent Principle-Piperine: A Review of Diverse Physiological Effects","title-short":"Black Pepper and its Pungent Principle-Piperine","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10408390601062054","volume":"47"},

  {"id":"steiner_2021_john","abstract":"What would medieval English literature look like if we viewed it through the lens of the compendium? In that case, Chaucer’s contemporary, John Trevisa, might come into focus as the major author of the fourteenth century. Trevisa (d. 1402) made a career of translating big informational Latin texts into English prose, supported by the patronage of the baron Thomas de Berkeley (1352–1417). These included Ranulph Higden’s\n              Polychronicon,\n              an enormous universal history with continuations to the present; Bartholomaeus Anglicus’s well-known natural encyclopedia\n              De proprietatibus rerum\n              ; and Giles of Rome’s beloved advice-for-princes manual,\n              De regimine principum.\n              These were shrewd choices, accessible and on trend:\n              De proprietatibus rerum\n              and\n              De regimine principum\n              had already been translated into French and copied in deluxe manuscripts for the French and English nobility, and the\n              Polychronicon\n              had been circulating England for several decades. This book argues that John Trevisa’s translations of compendious texts disclose an alternative literary history by way of medieval information culture. Modern readers typically encounter medieval English literature through Trevisa’s contemporaries, Chaucer, Gower, and Langland, a triumvirate representing a range of literary styles and languages formative to English letters. How might the nature of this encounter change if Trevisa was in the mix? Can big informational genres give us a purchase on medieval English poetry and prose? And how might Trevisa’s oeuvre enable us to envision a new literary history rooted in the compilation and translation of compendious information alongside texts traditionally labeled as literary?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Steiner","given":"Emily"}],"citation-key":"steiner_2021_john","DOI":"10.1093/oso/9780192896902.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-19-289690-2 978-0-19-191918-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,20]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Oxford University Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"John Trevisa's Information Age: Knowledge and the Pursuit of Literature, c. 1400","title-short":"John Trevisa's Information Age","type":"book","URL":"https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780192896902.001.0001/oso-9780192896902"},

They ha been especially keen to add explanatory accounts to the historical lite ture on empires. Starting in the 1950s, sociologists pioneered the stu of colonies as historical formations. Against traditional anthropologi approaches, sociologists insisted on studying colonizer and colonized their dynamic interactions, asking how both groups were being tran formed. Like contemporary postcolonial scholars, sociologists beg asking in the 1950s how metropoles were being remade by overse colonialism and colonial immigration. Echoing discussions in the 1950 among sociologists working in the colonies, current discussions of po colonial sociology question the applicability of Western social scienti concepts and theories to the global South and ask how sociology its has been shaped by empire. Current sociological research on empir focuses on six sets of causal mechanisms: (1) capitalism; (2) geopolitic war, and violence; (3) cultural representations and subjectivity; (4) res tance and collaboration by the colonized; (5) institutional dimensio of empires and colonies; and (6) conflict and compromise among co nizers at the heart of colonial states.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Steinmetz","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"steinmetz_2014_sociology","container-title":"Annual Review of Sociology","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"striklievers_2015_synaesthesia","abstract":"In the existing literature on synaesthetic metaphors in poetry it is proposed that transfers tend to go from the ‘lower’ (touch, smell, taste) to the ‘higher’ (sight, hearing) sensory modalities. The purpose of this article is to establish if the same directionality also holds for synaesthetic associations found in other text types. To this end, a method for the semi-automatic extraction of synaesthesia is introduced and applied to general-purpose corpora of English (ukWaC) and Italian (itWaC). In the data collected for these languages, most transfers proceed in the expected direction, e.g.\n              sweet voice\n              , but instances of ‘backward’ transfers are also found, e.g.\n              bitter cold\n              . Based on these results, it is claimed that the ‘directionality principle’ reflects the\n              frequency\n              of association types, rather than representing universal constraints on synaesthetic transfers, as has often been more or less explicitly assumed. It is here argued that both properties of human perception and more strictly linguistic factors can account for the frequency tendencies observed in synaesthesia. The proposed interpretation is also shown to account for apparently contradictory evidence coming from typological studies on verbs of perception.","author":[{"family":"Strik Lievers","given":"Francesca"}],"citation-key":"striklievers_2015_synaesthesia","container-title":"Functions of Language","container-title-short":"FOL","DOI":"10.1075/fol.22.1.04str","ISSN":"0929-998X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","page":"69-95","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Synaesthesia: A Corpus-based Study of Cross-modal Directionality","title-short":"Synaesthesia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/fol.22.1.04str","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"striklievers_2018_sensory","abstract":"Being able to talk about what humans perceive with their senses is one of the fundamental capacities of language. But how do languages encode perceptual information? In this paper, we analyze how experiences from different senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell) are encoded differentially across lexical categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives) in the English language. Three independently collected lists of perception-related words show that sound concepts are more prone to being expressed as verbs. Additional data show that nouns rated to strongly relate to motion are also rated to strongly relate to sound, more so than is the case for color-related nouns. We argue that the association of sound with verbs is due to sound concepts being inherently more dynamic, motion-related and event-based, in contrast to other sensory perceptions which are phenomenologically less strongly associated with motion and change. Overall, our results are the first to show differential encoding of perception-related concepts across different lexical categories. Our analyses of lexical patterns furthermore provide empirical evidence for the interconnection between semantics and grammar.","author":[{"family":"Strik Lievers","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Winter","given":"Bodo"}],"citation-key":"striklievers_2018_sensory","container-title":"Lingua","container-title-short":"Lingua","DOI":"10.1016/j.lingua.2017.11.002","ISSN":"0024-3841","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"45-61","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sensory language across lexical categories","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384117303558","volume":"204"},

The chapter one sorts and classifies incense vocabulary in ancient documents and classics and focuses on the four types of vocabulary of incense names,incense words,incense actions and other incense words.Describe and analyze the meaning of important words in each type of vocabulary. The chapter two studies the formation and development of incense vocabulary. Incense vocabulary is mainly generated by absorbing the common language components of the whole people,creating new words and foreign words.Absorbing the common language components of the whole people includes borrowing in general,transformation borrowing,metaphorical borrowing,and transfer borrowing.The emergence and development of incense has led to the emergence of new words. Explore the four situations of the enlargement,reduction,transfer and extinction of the meaning of incense words.The foreign words play an important role in the evolution of incense vocabulary.The foreign words in the incense vocabulary are examined and demonstrated and the characteristics of the foreign words are analyzed. The chapter three discusses the word formation of incense words from the perspective of morphemes.There are simple words and compound words.The simple words of incense vocabulary include reduplicated words and conjunctions.Compound words are the main way of word formation in Xiangshi vocabulary.It mainly studies four ways of word formation, which are combination,subject predicate, verb object and partial formal. The chapter four studies the phenomenon of incongruity words with the same name and different names,and analyzes the causes of these two phenomena.There are a lot of synonyms with similar names in the incense vocabulary.The naming justifications for such words include color factors,morphological factors,trait factors,origin factors,modification factors,rhetoric factors,space-time factors,elegant factors and social factors；There are words with the same name in the incense vocabulary.The naming justifications for this type of vocabulary include color factor,shape factor,shape factor,texture factor,beautification factor,and generic factor.","archive":"CNKI","author":[{"family":"Sun","given":"Zhumei"}],"citation-key":"sun_2020_gudai","contributor":[{"literal":"孙竹梅"}],"event-place":"Nanjing","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"Chinese","publisher":"Nanjing Normal University","publisher-place":"Nanjing","title":"古代香事类词汇研究 [A Study on the Vocabulary of Ancient Fragrances]","type":"thesis","URL":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CMFD&dbname=CMFD202101&filename=1021514945.nh&uniplatform=OVERSEA&v=bdAREjNDBkguQnPUl44YLbOXVui8RQ6Fu_jr_8C8EHAbnYxr8oU1ID5koWGGttZ5"},

  {"id":"swadling_2019_plumes","abstract":"The natural resources of New Guinea and nearby islands have attracted outsiders for at least 5000 years: spices, aromatic woods and barks, resins, plumes, sea slugs, shells and pearls all brought traders from distant markets. Among the most sought-after was the bird of paradise. Their magnificent plumes bedecked the hats of fashion-conscious women in Europe and America, provided regalia for the Kings of Nepal, and decorated the headdresses of Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire. Plumes from Paradise tells the story of this interaction, and of the economic, political, social and cultural consequence for the island's inhabitants. It traces 400 years of economic and political history, culminating in the 'plume boom' of the early part of the 20th century, when an unprecedented number of outsiders flocked to the island's coasts and hinterlands. The story teems with the variety of people involved: New Guineans, Indonesians, Chinese, Europeans, hunters, traders, natural historians and their collectors, officials, missionaries, planters, miners, adventurers of every kind. In the wings were the conservationists, whose efforts brought the slaughter of the plume boom to an end and ushered in an era of comparative isolation for the island that lasted until World War II.","author":[{"family":"Swadling","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Wagner","given":"Roy"},{"family":"Laba","given":"Billai"}],"citation-key":"swadling_2019_plumes","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv10vkzrf","ISBN":"978-1-74332-544-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"Sydney University Press","title":"Plumes from paradise: Trade cycles in outer Southeast Asia and their impact on New Guinea and nearby islands until 1920","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv10vkzrf"},

The result was a massive circulation of people, commodities, religion, culture, technology, and ideas. In this book, Eric Tagliacozzo chronicles how the seas and oceans of Asia have shaped the history of the largest continent for the past half millennium, leaving an indelible mark on the modern world in the process.Paying special attention to migration, trade, the environment, and cities, In Asian Waters examines the long history of contact between China and East Africa; the spread of Hinduism and Buddhism across the Bay of Bengal; and the intertwined histories of Islam and Christianity in the Philippines. The book illustrates how India became central to the spice trade; how the Indian Ocean became a \"British lake\" between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries; and how lighthouses and sea mapping played important roles in imperialism. The volume ends by asking what may happen if China comes to rule the waves of Asia, as Britain once did.

  {"id":"tanzer_2023_benchmark","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) can perform impressive feats with in-context learning or lightweight finetuning. It is natural to wonder how well these models adapt to genuinely new tasks, but how does one find tasks that are unseen in internet-scale training sets? We turn to a field that is explicitly motivated and bottlenecked by a scarcity of web data: low-resource languages. In this paper, we introduce MTOB (Machine Translation from One Book), a benchmark for learning to translate between English and Kalamang -- a language with less than 200 speakers and therefore virtually no presence on the web -- using several hundred pages of field linguistics reference materials. This task framing is novel in that it asks a model to learn a language from a single human-readable book of grammar explanations, rather than a large mined corpus of in-domain data, more akin to L2 learning than L1 acquisition. We demonstrate that baselines using current LLMs are promising but fall short of human performance, achieving 44.7 chrF on Kalamang to English translation and 45.8 chrF on English to Kalamang translation, compared to 51.6 and 57.0 chrF by a human who learned Kalamang from the same reference materials. We hope that MTOB will help measure LLM capabilities along a new dimension, and that the methods developed to solve it could help expand access to language technology for underserved communities by leveraging qualitatively different kinds of data than traditional machine translation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Tanzer","given":"Garrett"},{"family":"Suzgun","given":"Mirac"},{"family":"Visser","given":"Eline"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Melas-Kyriazi","given":"Luke"}],"citation-key":"tanzer_2023_benchmark","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,28]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2309.16575","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"A benchmark for learning to translate a new language from one grammar book","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16575"},

The popular Singaporean–English phrase “Die die must try” is not so much hyperbole as it is a reflection of the lengths that Singaporeans will go to find great dishes. This book argues that in a society that has undergone substantial change in a relatively short amount of time, food serves Singaporeans as a poignant connection to the past. Covering the period from British settlement in 1819 to the present and focusing on the post-1965 postcolonial era, the book tells the story of Singapore through the production and consumption of food. Analyzing a variety of sources that range from cookbooks to architectural and city plans, the book offers a thematic history of this unusual country, which was colonized by the British and operated as a port within Malaya, but which is without a substantial pre-colonial history. Connecting food culture to the larger history of Singapore, the book discusses various topics including domesticity and home economics, housing and architecture, advertising, and the regulation of food-related manners and public behavior such as hawking, littering, and chewing gum. Moving away from the predominantly political and economic focus of other histories of Singapore, the book provides an important alternative reading of Singaporean society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Tarulevicz","given":"Nicole"}],"citation-key":"tarulevicz_2013_eating","DOI":"10.5406/illinois/9780252038099.001.0001","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-0-252-03809-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12,20]]},"language":"en","publisher":"University of Illinois Press","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Eating her curries and kway: A cultural history of food in Singapore","title-short":"Eating her curries and kway","type":"book","URL":"http://illinois.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5406/illinois/9780252038099.001.0001/upso-9780252038099"},

  {"id":"thomas_2020_controversial","abstract":"India's medical heritage across its two streams of experiential knowledge viz. the classical (codiﬁed) and folk (oral) reveals an incredible range and depth of knowledge of medicinal plants. In the classical stream of Ayurveda, across the period from 1500 BCE to 1900 CE, there is information of more than 12,000 distinct Sanskrit plant names with overlaps across texts. This information is captured in more than 200 texts viz. 6 samhitas, 57 nighantus and 140 vyakhyas. The information about plants has three major dimensions in codiﬁed literature viz. morphological description (rupa gnana), pharmacology (dravya guna shastra) and pharmacy (bhaishajya kalpana). The morphological information is however sketchy and wholly inadequate for establishing botanical identity. Thus despite the huge corpus of plant names backed by sophisticated understanding of pharmacology and pharmacy there is the fact of controversial identities of medicinal plants. Why is this the case? The author believes that the gap in morphological detailing is due to the ‘experiential’ pedagogy of India's health tradition. While knowledge transmission of plants included theoretical propositions and sophisticated logic related to pharmacology, it also assumed an oral, practical and experiential system of learning about the identity of plants through ﬁeld work. The purpose of this research is to understand the range and depth at which we have understood the problem of controversial identities of medicinal plants, to analyze work done in the ﬁeld and to propose a Trans disciplinary approach to solve the problem of controversial identities of medicinal plants in Ayurveda.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Thomas","given":"Varghese"},{"family":"Nair","given":"S.N.Venugopalan"},{"family":"Ved","given":"D.K."},{"family":"Shankar","given":"Darshan"}],"citation-key":"thomas_2020_controversial","container-title":"Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine","container-title-short":"Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine","DOI":"10.1016/j.jaim.2019.09.003","ISSN":"09759476","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10]]},"language":"en","page":"565-572","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Controversial identities of medicinal plants in classical literature of Ayurveda","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0975947618303747","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"tinney_2019_journey","abstract":"The Penn Museum has a long and storied history of research and archaeological exploration in the ancient Middle East. This book highlights this rich depth of knowledge while also serving as a companion volume to the Museum's signature Middle East Galleries opening in April 2018. This edited volume includes chapters and integrated short, focused pieces from Museum curators and staff actively involved in the detailed planning of the new galleries. In addition to highlighting the most remarkable and interesting objects in the Museum's extraordinary Middle East collections, this volume illuminates the primary themes within these galleries (make, settle, connect, organize, and believe) and provides a larger context within which to understand them. The ancient Middle East is home to the first urban settlements in human history, dating to the fourth millennium BCE; therefore, tracing this move toward city life figures prominently in the book. The topic of urbanization, how it came about and how these early steps still impact our daily lives, is explored from regional and localized perspectives, bringing us from Mesopotamia (Ur, Uruk, and Nippur) to Islamic and Persianate cites (Rayy and Isfahan) and, finally, connecting back to life in modern Philadelphia. Through examination of topics such as landscape, resources, trade, religious belief and burial practices, daily life, and nomads, this very important human journey is investigated both broadly and with specific case studies.","author":[{"family":"Tinney","given":"Steve"},{"family":"Sonik","given":"Karen"}],"citation-key":"tinney_2019_journey","DOI":"10.2307/j.ctv16t6dn3","ISBN":"978-1-931707-14-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"University of Pennsylvania Press","title":"Journey to the city: A companion to the Middle East galleries at the Penn museum","type":"book","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv16t6dn3 https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv16t6dn3?refreqid=excelsior%3Acbc1ba6b7295def5820cfaae72d6f222"},

By contrast, the study of the early stages of academic and cultural Orientalism has been neglected. For the beginnings of Oriental studies in Europe one still largely relies on institutional histories and archival research, or even V. V. Barthold's 80-year-old study. The birth of academic Orientalism in the 17th century was occasioned by three major factors: a renewed interest in Islam, major advances in travel and exploration, and the emergence of modern approaches to science and education. Among important background developments were the decline of the perceived Arab threat followed by the rise of a very real Ottoman Turkish one, the geographical shift in hostilities from the European West to the East, and the realignment of European alliances and attitudes in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Tolmacheva","given":"Marina"}],"citation-key":"tolmacheva_1995_medieval","container-title":"International Journal of Middle East Studies","container-title-short":"Int.

More than 100 loan words are scritinized and classified in eight sections, according to their origin: Old Iranian (probably issued from the common ancestry of the ‘Sakan’ languages, Khotanese, Tumshuqese and Waxi), three different stages of Khotanese, ‘Śaka’, (the language of the Iranian invaders of northern India), Parthian, Bactrian and Sogdian. Tocharians had dealings with all neighbouring Iranian peoples, but Khotanese and its ancestors clearly exerted the most durable influence. No loan word from more remote dialects (e.g. Persian and Ossetic) can be evidenced. The predominance of war-related and political vocabulary among the loan words and the direction of borrowing, overwhelmingly from Iranian to Tocharian, both point to a political ascendancy of Sakan-speaking tribes, and later of Bactria, on Tocharians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tremblay","given":"Xavier"}],"citation-key":"tremblay_2005_iranotocharica","container-title":"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies","container-title-short":"Bull.

  {"id":"tresso_2023_india","abstract":"Abstract\n            \n              The famous Moroccan traveller Muḥammad b. Baṭṭūṭa, who left Tangier in 1325, claims to have made a journey that took him across most of the then Islamicate world. The country in which he recounts having stayed the longest was India, where he says he remained from 1333 to 1341/1342, mostly in the Islamic Sultanate of Delhi. A long section of his\n              Riḥla\n              is dedicated to the sub-continent and modern historians of this region ascribe to it an important documentary value, although it has been argued that Ibn Baṭṭūṭa may have borrowed – not to imply copied – information from other sources in other parts of the work. As concerns India, Ibn Baṭṭūṭa speaks of two epidemics and one deadly disease that occurred in 1334–5 and 1344. Some scholars have referred to them as cholera, while others have suggested it was the plague – thus supporting the hypothesis that the medieval plague pandemic had struck India before reaching the Middle East. How did this confusion arise? What exactly does Ibn Baṭṭūṭa's\n              Riḥla\n              relate? Do Indo-Persian sources confirm these epidemics? Do they and/or Ibn Baṭṭūṭa's\n              Riḥla\n              allow us to discount the presence of the Medieval Plague in India, or rather do they assert it?\n            \n            \n              In order to answer these questions, this paper analyses the information on the Indian epidemics in Ibn Baṭṭūṭa's\n              Riḥla\n              and compares the text with its translations in the principal European languages and with Indo-Persian chronicles. These analyses reveal something of a lexical muddle which, in my opinion, has contributed to some errors and misunderstandings regarding the diseases in question. But another question arises: is it possible to read the information provided by Ibn Baṭṭūṭa and the Indian chronicles in a consilient way, that is, taking into account not only the analysis of written documents, but also the recent and current findings in genetics of plague, and in particular on the Black Death? Finally, an attempt is made to answer a question that has to be asked, particularly in light of the criticism often levelled at Ibn Baṭṭūṭa. Considering that in one of these events he claims to have witnessed the epidemic, is there any reason to suppose that he did not? Regarding the other two events that he did not claim to witness firsthand, is there any cause to doubt his claims?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Tresso","given":"Claudia Maria"}],"citation-key":"tresso_2023_india","container-title":"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies","container-title-short":"Bull.

But what leads people to take risks in everyday life is the hope of gaining an advantage -usually a financial one. If we consider European economic activity before the \"discovery\" of the New World by Christopher Columbus, it is clear that it was mainly the centers of the spice trade where wealth was accumulated. The palaces of Venice and Genoa, the riches of the Fugger and Welser merchant families of southern Germany, and the splendor of Lisbon and Amsterdam were established mainly on the profits from the spice trade. The route the spices took from the East Indies to the Occident was both difficult and dangerous. The spices were mostly harvested by slaves, and then sailed or paddled in tiny praos from the Spice Islands (the Moluccas) to Malacca. From there, they were shipped in junks across two or three dangerous tropical seas. After that, this freight was carried on camelback through the desert from Aden to Egypt, becoming more expensive at each stage. Emirs, sultans, and pirates levied high customs tariffs on whatever had not been lost to typhoons, sandstorms, or other pirates. The exotic freight passed through at least a dozen hands before it was received by European merchant firms in Alexandria or Constantinople.","author":[{"family":"Udo","given":"Pollmer"}],"citation-key":"udo_2000_spice","container-title":"Migration & Diffusion","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000"]]},"title":"THE SPICE TRADE AND ITS IMPORTANCE FOR EUROPEAN EXPANSION","type":"Journal Article","volume":"1"},

  {"id":"vandam_2010_arabic","abstract":"How did Arabic loanwords end up in Indonesian? Various academic answers to this intriguing question have been put forward, but only rarely has any solid linguistic 'proof' been provided. General conclusions have been drawn on the basis of a few, rather unrepresentative or obsolete, examples. Academics have copied arguments and hypotheses from one another, without any independent research into their reliability. Some of the arguments, or pure hypotheses, have obtained the status of pseudo 'established fact', irrespective of the fact that they lack academic justification. This article makes an effort to put the record straight by showing that a Persian or Persianized connection cannot be proven statistically, as claimed by Stuart Campbell. It also shows that some loanwords have a colloquial, occasionaly even regionally identifiable Arabic origin, but that the claim by Versteegh and others of a South Arabian or Hadrami connection cannot be convincingly established. It finally demonstrates that more attention should be given to the linguistic particularities of the recipient (Indonesian/Nusantara) language, than to concentrate mainly on the characteristics of the Arabic language which provided these loanwords. Unknown Arabic phonemes deserve special attention because they were in some cases interpreted and adopted by Indonesian/Nusantara listeners as phonemes that were phonetically nearest to these, and which were part of their own phoneme system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Dam","given":"Nikolaos"}],"citation-key":"vandam_2010_arabic","container-title":"Bijdragen tot de taal-, land- en volkenkunde / Journal of the Humanities and Social Sciences of Southeast Asia","container-title-short":"Bijdr taal land volkenkd","DOI":"10.1163/22134379-90003617","ISSN":"0006-2294, 2213-4379","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","page":"218-243","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Arabic loanwords in Indonesian revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/bki/166/2-3/article-p218_3.xml","volume":"166"},
  {"id":"vanderveen_2003_when","abstract":"[This paper explores definitions of luxury foods and considers the role of luxuries in marking social distinction. It is proposed that luxury foods are those foods that offer a refinement in texture, taste, fat content or other quality (such as stimulant or inebriant) and offer distinction, because of either their quantity or quality. Ethnographic research has revealed that an emphasis on quantity of food and elaboration of common staples is found mostly in societies without strong social stratification, while an emphasis on quality and style is characteristic of societies with institutionalized forms of social ranking. In the former context the consumption of luxury foods is used primarily to create or enhance social bonds, in the latter to create or enhance exclusivity and distance. The archaeological recognition of luxury foods is reviewed to demonstrate how archaeology is well placed to add regional breadth and chronological depth to the study of the changing role and meaning of luxury foods.]","author":[{"family":"Veen","given":"Marijke","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"vanderveen_2003_when","container-title":"World Archaeology","ISSN":"00438243, 14701375","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"page":"405-427","title":"When Is Food a Luxury?","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3560194","volume":"34"},
  {"id":"vanderveen_2010_agricultural","abstract":"[Agricultural innovations are primarily concerned with a need for increasing production (of food, fodder, secondary products) as well as enhancing quality (of produce, production process, growing conditions). This paper reviews current thinking on how improvements and innovations in agriculture arise, what forms they take and what agents are involved. Innovations typically affect one or more of the following areas: crops, animals, growing conditions, implements and management practices. While 'macro-inventions' (radical new ideas) do occur, many concern 'micro-inventions', that is changes or modifications to tools and practices made by skilled practitioners (farmers, craftspeople), rather than by inventors or entrepreneurs. Indeed, agricultural innovations frequently concern not so much the adoption of newly introduced technologies, but the adaptation of existing ones. The term 'agricultural revolution' tends to be used when a number of improvements in separate areas of the farming system co-occur as a complex, and, although these may be introduced gradually, once they reach a critical mass their impact on society may be of a magnitude deserving of the term 'revolution'.]","author":[{"family":"Veen","given":"Marijke","non-dropping-particle":"van der"}],"citation-key":"vanderveen_2010_agricultural","container-title":"World Archaeology","ISSN":"00438243, 14701375","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"page":"1-12","title":"Agricultural innovation: invention and adoption or change and adaptation?","type":"Journal Article","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/25679724","volume":"42"},

  {"id":"vasconcelos_2018_antibacterial","abstract":"Background In the current healthcare environment, an alarming rise in multi-drug resistant bacterial infections has led to a global health threat. The lack of new antibiotics has created a need for developing alternative strategies. Objective Understanding the antibacterial mechanisms of cinnamon and its constituents is crucial to enhance it as a potential new source of antibiotic. The objective of this review is to provide a compilation of all described mechanisms of antibacterial action of cinnamon and its constituents and synergism with commercial antibiotics in order to better understand how cinnamon and its constituents can collaborate as alternative treatment to multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Methods The relevant references on antibacterial activities of cinnamon and its constituents were searched. Meanwhile, the references were classified according to the type of mechanism of action against bacteria. Relationships of cinnamon or its constituents and antibiotics were also analyzed and summarized. Results Cinnamon extracts, essential oils, and their compounds have been reported to inhibit bacteria by damaging cell membrane; altering the lipid profile; inhibiting ATPases, cell division, membrane porins, motility, and biofilm formation; and via anti-quorum sensing effects. Conclusion This review describes the antibacterial effects of cinnamon and its constituents, such as cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, against pathogenic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The review also provides an overview of the current knowledge of the primary modes of action of these compounds as well as the synergistic interactions between cinnamon or its constituents with known antibacterial agents. This information will be useful in improving the effectiveness of therapeutics based on these compounds.","author":[{"family":"Vasconcelos","given":"N.

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.","author":[{"family":"Vaswani","given":"Ashish"},{"family":"Shazeer","given":"Noam"},{"family":"Parmar","given":"Niki"},{"family":"Uszkoreit","given":"Jakob"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Llion"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Aidan N"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Łukasz"},{"family":"Polosukhin","given":"Illia"}],"citation-key":"vaswani__attention","event-place":"Long Beach, CA, USA","event-title":"31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Long Beach, CA, USA","source":"Zotero","title":"Attention is All you Need","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"vazquez-fresno_2019_herbs","abstract":"Culinary herbs and spices have been used as both food flavoring and food preservative agents for centuries. Moreover, due to their known and presumptive health benefits, herbs and spices have also been used in medical practices since ancient times. Some of the health effects attributed to herbs and spices include antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory effects as well as potential protection against cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. While interest in herbs and spices as medicinal agents remains high and their use in foods continues to grow, there have been remarkably few studies that have attempted to track the dietary intake of herbs and spices and even fewer that have tried to find potential biomarkers of food intake (BFIs). The aim of the present review is to systematically survey the global literature on herbs and spices in an effort to identify and evaluate specific intake biomarkers for a representative set of common herbs and spices in humans. A total of 25 herbs and spices were initially chosen, including anise, basil, black pepper, caraway, chili pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, curcumin, dill, fennel, fenugreek, ginger, lemongrass, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, peppermint and spearmint, rosemary, saffron, sage, tarragon, and thyme. However, only 17 of these herbs and spices had published, peer-reviewed studies describing potential biomarkers of intake. In many studies, the herb or spice of interest was administrated in the form of a capsule or extract and very few studies were performed with actual foods. A systematic assessment of the candidate biomarkers was also performed. Given the limitations in the experimental designs for many of the published studies, further work is needed to better evaluate the identified set of BFIs. Although the daily intake of herbs and spices is very low compared to most other foods, this important set of food seasoning agents should not be underestimated, especially given their potential benefits to human health.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Vázquez-Fresno","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Rosana","given":"Albert Remus R."},{"family":"Sajed","given":"Tanvir"},{"family":"Onookome-Okome","given":"Tuviere"},{"family":"Wishart","given":"Noah A."},{"family":"Wishart","given":"David S."}],"citation-key":"vazquez-fresno_2019_herbs","container-title":"Genes & Nutrition","container-title-short":"Genes Nutr","DOI":"10.1186/s12263-019-0636-8","ISSN":"1555-8932, 1865-3499","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Herbs and Spices- Biomarkers of Intake Based on Human Intervention Studies – A Systematic Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://genesandnutrition.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12263-019-0636-8","volume":"14"},

We aim to find answers to the question of how and in which fields the social elites, who have been settling down in the Basin in different times starting from the 1970s with the intention to live there, contributed to the changes occurring in the local society and economy. Furthermore, we are eager to know what kind of interconnections can be found between the transformations and the responsibility felt for the place itself and its inhabitants. The newcomers’ impact on the basin is both symbolic and material. People moving into the villages of the Káli Basin not only played a substantial part in the production and popularization of the Káli Basin’s representation, but, in time, became significant actors of local economy.","author":[{"family":"Veronika","given":"Lajos"},{"family":"Zsolt","given":"Szijártó"}],"citation-key":"veronika__transformations","language":"hu","page":"24","source":"Zotero","title":"Transformations of the Shape of the Káli Basin, Hungary 2.0","type":"article-journal"},

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy normal-weight volunteers, 19 healthy overweight subjects, and 22 obese subjects were enrolled. For each subject, the lateralization Oldfield score, body weight, height, and blood pressure were determined. The taste test is based on filter paper strips soaked with 4 taste stimuli presented at different concentrations to evoke 4 basic taste qualities (salty, sour, sweet, and bitter); pure rapeseed oil and water were also administered to evoke fat and neutral taste qualities. The stimuli were applied to each side of the protruded tongue. Subjects were asked to identify the taste from a list of eight descriptions according to a multiple choice paradigm. RESULTS: The results showed a general lowering of taste sensitivity with the increase of BMI, except for the taste of fat with rapeseed oil as the stimulus. Other variables affecting taste sensitivity are age (negative association), gender (women generally show higher sensitivity), and taste stimuli concentration (positive association). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could provide important insights into how new therapies could be designed for weight loss and long-term weight maintenance and how diets could be planned combining the correct caloric and nutritional supply with individual taste preferences.","author":[{"family":"Vignini","given":"Arianna"},{"family":"Borroni","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Sabbatinelli","given":"Jacopo"},{"family":"Pugnaloni","given":"Sofia"},{"family":"Alia","given":"Sonila"},{"family":"Taus","given":"Marina"},{"family":"Ferrante","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Mazzanti","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Fabri","given":"Mara"}],"citation-key":"vignini_2019_general","container-title":"Disease markers","DOI":"10.1155/2019/2978026","ISSN":"1875-8630 0278-0240","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"2978026-2978026","title":"General Decrease of Taste Sensitivity Is Related to Increase of BMI: A Simple Method to Monitor Eating Behavior","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31089392 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6476129/","volume":"2019"},

The rise of Manila as a crucial transshipment port was not a spontaneous incident. Instead, it came about through a complex combination of circumstances and interconnections that nurtured the establishment of the Manila Galleon system, a trading mechanism that lasted two and half centuries from 1565 until 1815. Villamar analyses the establishment of the regulatory framework of the trade across the Pacific Ocean as a whole setting that provided legality to the transactions, predictability to the transportation and security to the stakeholders. He looks both at the Spanish crown strategy in Asia, and the emergence of a network of Portuguese merchants located in Manila and active in the long-distance trade. This informal community of merchants participated from the inception of the trading system across the Pacific, with connections between Europe, ports in Asia under the control of Portugal, the Spanish colonies in America, and the city of Manila. From its inception, the newly-founded capital of the Philippines became a hub of connections, attracting part of the trade that already existed in Asia. Surveying the Portuguese commercial networks from the 'Estado da Índia' across the 'Spanish lake,' this book sheds light on the early modern globalization from a truly comprehensive Iberian perspective. This is a valuable resource for scholars of Pacific and Iberian trade history and the maritime history of Asia\"--","author":[{"family":"Villamar","given":"Cuauhtémoc"}],"call-number":"HE861 .V55 2021","citation-key":"villamar_2021_portuguese","event-place":"Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","ISBN":"978-0-367-61554-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon ; New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Portuguese merchants in the Manila galleon system: 1565-1600","title-short":"Portuguese merchants in the Manila galleon system","type":"book"},

  {"id":"waines_2010_odyssey","abstract":"Ibn Battuta was, without doubt, one of the world's truly great travellers. Born in fourteenth-century Morocco, and a contemporary of Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta has left us an account in his own words of his remarkable journeys throughout the Islamic world and beyond: journeys punctuated by adventure and peril, and stretching from his home in Tangier to Zaitun in faraway China.Whether sojourning in Delhi and the Maldives, wandering through the mazy streets of Cairo and Damascus, or contesting with pirates and shipwreck, the indefatigable Ibn Battuta brings to vivid life a medieval world brimming with marvel and mystery. Carefully observing the great diversity of civilizations that he encountered, Ibn Battuta exhibits an omnivorous interest in such matters as food and drink, religious differences (among Christians, Hindus and Shia Muslims), ideas about purity and impurity, disease, women and sex. Recounting the many miracles that its author claims to have experienced personally, his al-rihla or 'Travelogue' is a fascinating mosaic of mysticism and reportage offering a prototype magic realism. David Waines discusses the subtleties of the al-rihla, revealing all the wonders of Ibn Battuta's world to the modern reader. This is a gripping treatment of the life and times of one of history's most daring, and at the same time most human, discoverers.","author":[{"family":"Waines","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"waines_2010_odyssey","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978 1 84511 805 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"publisher":"I.

With its roots in the colonial periods of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, its rapid development since the 1980s warrants a reevaluation of where the field stands today. This Handbook represents for the first time a survey of Islamic archaeology on a global scale, describing its disciplinary development and offering candid critiques of the state of the field today in the Central Islamic Lands, the Islamic West, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. The international contributors to the volume address such themes as the timing and process of Islamization, the problems of periodization and regionalism in material culture, cities and countryside, cultural hybridity, cultural and religious diversity, natural resource management, international trade in the later historical periods, and migration. Critical assessments of the ways in which archaeologists today engage with Islamic cultural heritage and local communities closes the volume, highlighting the ethical issues related to studying living cultures and religions.

We hypothesize that human bitter taste receptor (TAS2R) genes might be relaxed from selective constraints because of the change in diet, use of fire and reliance on other means of toxin avoidance that emerged in human evolution. Here, we examine the intra-specific variations of all 25 genes of the human TAS2R repertoire. Our data show hallmarks of neutral evolution, including similar rates of synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) nucleotide changes among rare polymorphisms, common polymorphisms and substitutions; no variation in dN/dS among functional domains; segregation of pseudogene alleles within species and fixation of loss-of-function mutations. These results, together with previous findings of large numbers of loss-of-function mutations in olfactory, pheromonal and visual sensory genes in humans, suggest surprisingly reduced sensory capabilities of humans in comparison with many other mammals.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaoxia"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Stephanie D."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jianzhi"}],"citation-key":"wang_2004_relaxation","container-title":"Human Molecular Genetics","DOI":"10.1093/hmg/ddh289","ISSN":"0964-6906","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"page":"2671-2678","title":"Relaxation of Selective Constraint and Loss of Function in the Evolution of Human Bitter Taste Receptor Genes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/hmg/ddh289","volume":"13"},

Materials and methods A bibliographic investigation was carried out by analyzing recognized books including Chinese herbal classic, and worldwide accepted scientific databases (Pubmed, SciFinder, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched for the available information on I. verum. Results I. verum is an aromatic evergreen tree of the family Illiciaceae. It is sometimes contaminated with highly toxic Japanese star anise (I. anisatum L.) and poisonous star anise (I. lanceolatum A. C. Smith), which contain several neurotoxic sesquiterpenes. Traditional uses of I. verum are recorded throughout Asia and Northern America, where it has been used for more than 10 types of disorders. Numerous compounds including volatiles, seco-prezizaane-type sesquiterpenes, phenylpropanoids, lignans, flavonoids and other constituents have been identified from I. verum. Modern pharmacology studies demonstrated that its crude extracts and active compounds possess wide pharmacological actions, especially in antimicrobial, antioxidant, insecticidal, analgesic, sedative and convulsive activities. In addition, it is the major source of shikimic acid, a primary ingredient in the antiflu drug (Tamiflu).

  {"id":"wang_2017_sound","abstract":"Rigorous sound correspondence is fundamental to historical linguistics. It serves as a solid start in studying genetic relationship. Regarding the genetic position of Miao-Yao languages, Li (1937) proposed a hypothesis that the SinoTibetan language family consists of Chinese, Tibeto-Burman, Kam-Tai, and Miao-Yao. Benedict (1942; 1975) excluded Miao-Yao from the Sino-Tibetan language family since sound correspondences between Miao-Yao and Chinese were considered to be caused by language contact. The key point in this debate has been ignored for a long time: are the related morphemes proposed in this debate supported by rigorous sound correspondence? In this paper, related morphemes across 11 Miao-Yao languages have been first identified under the requirement of complete sound correspondence, and then analyzed by the Rank Method. The result of the genetic relationship between the 11 Miao-Yao languages has been confirmed. The same procedure has been applied to Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes, and similar pattern has been found. The Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes were recognized to be inherited from the common ancestor of Chinese and Miao-Yao. Combined with the result from the perspective of pervasive sound correspondence (Wang 2015), the proposal of a genetic relationship between Chinese and MiaoYao has been supported. The Inexplicability Principle has been used to weaken the possibility of Sino-Miao-Yao related morphemes being induced by borrowing from Chinese to Miao-Yao, since some sound correspondences are unlikely to be explained by natural phonetic mechanisms. Moreover, related morphemes in Chinese and Miao-Yao have been examined from the perspective of Old Chinese, and such an examination also supports the hypothesis of a genetic relationship between Chinese and Miao-Yao languages.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Wen"}],"citation-key":"wang_2017_sound","container-title":"Bulletin of Chinese Linguistics","contributor":[{"literal":"汪鋒"},{"literal":"劉文"}],"DOI":"10.1163/2405478X-01001006","ISSN":"1933-6985, 2405-478X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"95-119","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Sound Correspondence and the Comparative Study of Miao-Yao Languages (語音對應與苗瑤語比較研究): From the Perspective of Complete Sound Correspondence (從完全對應的角度看)","title-short":"Sound Correspondence and the Comparative Study of Miao-Yao Languages (語音對應與苗瑤語比較研究)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/bcl/10/1/article-p95_95.xml","volume":"10"},

The results showed that: (1) From across 191 temples, we observed a total of 1,059 tree species, belonging to 116 families and 410 genera with most species (n = 773) occurred in only one or two temples. (2) Temple gardens were rich in native and threatened tree species (n = 94), and thus, are of high biodiversity conservation value. (3) The tree species composition of Buddhist temples in different climatic zones was quite different. (4) Tree species across temples had a distinct replacement phenomenon where original Buddhist tree species were gradually replaced by native species similar to the native flora, from south to north. The above results suggest that Chinese temples have very rich plant resource and that their effective protection may play a positive role in maintaining regional biodiversity and improving urban greening.","archive_location":"http://www.biodiversity-science.net","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Xinyang"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Cheng"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Lihua"},{"family":"Zheng","given":"Mingming"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Shenhua"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yongchuan"}],"citation-key":"wang_2020_zhongguofojiaosimiaozhiwuduoyangxinghefojiaoshuzhongtidai","container-title":"Biodiversity Science","DOI":"10.17520/biods.2019392","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"note":"Note: In Chinese with English abstract","page":"668-677","title":"中國佛教寺廟植物多樣性和佛教樹種替代 [Plant Diversity and Species Replacement in Chinese Buddhist Temples]","title-short":"中国佛教寺庙植物多样性和佛教树种替代","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

Al-Quran is one of the best reference book, describing the importance of plants, especially herbs in different Surahs for their diverse uses. Herbs had been priced for their medicinal, flavouring and aromatic qualities for centuries. Today herbal products symbolise safety in contrast to the synthetics that are regarded as unsafe to human and environment, and people are returning to the naturals with hope of safety and security. Herbs are staging a comeback and herbal ‘renaissance’ is happening all over the globe. So in this backdrop the present study throws light on the importance of some herbs with respect to medicinal properties, in modern times, mentioned in the Holy Quran and Ahidath more than 1400 years ago.","author":[{"family":"Wani","given":"Bilal Ahmad"},{"family":"Wani","given":"Fida Mohammad"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Amina"},{"family":"Bodha","given":"R H"},{"family":"Mohiddin","given":"F A"},{"family":"Hamid","given":"Aadil"}],"citation-key":"wani_2011_herbs","container-title":"Journal of Pharmacy Research","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"5","source":"Zotero","title":"Some herbs mentioned in the holy Quran and ahadith and their medicinal importance in contemporary times","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"wei_2019_tangdai","abstract":"The large-scale maritime trade between China and East Asia, Southeast Asia, West Asia and East Africa began in the middle and late Tang Dynasty, and the main trade commodity was ceramics. The \"secret porcelain\" produced in the north-central region of Zhejiang Province was the main commodity of maritime trade between China and other countries in this period. According to the observations of the unearthed Chinese ceramics from various countries, the \"secret porcelain\" produced by the Yue kiln spread throughout North Korea, South Korea, Japan, Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, Egypt and other coastal countries. The export lasted from Tang to Song Dynasty for more than 300 years. The main export port of the \"secret porcelain\" is ancient Mingzhou (now Ningbo) Port. The cross-border trade routes of \"secret porcelain\" consisted of three routes based on distances: i) northeast route, which is to the East Asia; ii) southeast route, which is to the Southeast Asia; and (iii) southwest route, which is to the South Asia, West Asia, and East Africa. There were four main reasons why China opened up maritime trade channels in Tang Dynasty: first, the Silk Road between China and West Asia was cut off; second, the \"secret porcelain\" traded is of high quality, in large quantity and fragile, so it was not suitable for land transportation; Third, people in Tang Dynasty have mastered shipbuilding and ocean-going navigation technology; fourth, the Tang Dynasty offered incentives to support overseas trade. The large-scale export of \"secret porcelain\" could improve the quality of people's life in importing countries, and at the same time, spread Chinese culture all over the world.","author":[{"family":"Wei","given":"Jiangang"}],"citation-key":"wei_2019_tangdai","container-title":"World Regional Studies","contributor":[{"literal":"魏建钢"}],"DOI":"10.3969/j.issn.1004-9479.2019.05.","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"172-180","title":"唐代“海上丝绸之路”兴起的原因分析——以越窑“秘色瓷”出口为例 [Reasons of the emergence of Maritime Silk Road in Tang Dynasty: Taking the export of \"secret porcelain\" in Yue kiln as an example]","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

This vernacular borrows from grassroots romanization, English phonetics, number substitutions, and bilingualism in English and Cantonese to exclude all readers except young Hong Kong people, who show high bilingualism and high tech literacy and share the vocabulary of protesters. This essay explores aspects of this protest vernacular through non-comprehensive analysis of a thread on LIHKG (Lineage: Hong Kong Golden) lin dang 連黨 that is the first recorded example of “Kong girl speech.” Aspects of Kong nui ping jam identified here are: use of both Cantonese and English vocabulary, use of protest-specific vocabulary, loose romanization that does not correlate to any existing system, textspeak such as abbreviations, and number substitutions borrowed from both English and Cantonese. As well as Kong nui ping jam, another online vernacular is “Kongish,” most visible on the “Kongish Daily” Facebook page, which has a mostly English vocabulary but borrows ending particles, difficult-totranslate vocabulary, and grammar structures from Cantonese, so that the sentence is legible in English but recognizably Cantonese in origin.","author":[{"family":"Wetters","given":"Ruth"}],"citation-key":"wetters__kong","container-title":"Sino-Platonic Papers","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Kong Girl Phonetics: Loose Cantonese Romanization in the 2019 Hong Kong Protest Movement","type":"article-journal","volume":"317"},

We present results related to discriminative learning of Bayesian network parameters. Along the way, we explicitly identify a number of problems arising in Bayesian model class selection. This leads us to information theory and, more speciﬁcally, the minimum description length (MDL) principle. We look at its theoretic foundations and practical implications. The MDL approach provides elegant solutions for the problem of model class selection and enables us to objectively compare any set of models, regardless of their parametric structure. Finally, we apply these methods to problems arising in computational etymology. We develop model families for the task of sound-by-sound alignment across kindred languages. Fed with linguistic data in the form of cognate sets, our methods provide information about the correspondence of sounds, as well as the history and ancestral structure of a language family. As a running example we take the family of Uralic languages.","author":[{"family":"Wettig","given":"Hannes"}],"citation-key":"wettig__probabilistic","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Probabilistic, Information-Theoretic Models for Etymological Alignment","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"wierzbicka_2022_thou","abstract":"This paper argues that “YOU” and “I” (“I” and “THOU”) are fundamental elements of human thought, present as distinct words (or signs) in all human languages. I first developed this thesis in my 1976 article “In defense of YOU and ME” (and before that, introduced it in my 1972 book Semantic Primitives; cf. also my 2021 article “‘Semantic Primitives’, fifty years later”). Since then, it has been confirmed by wide-ranging cross-linguistic investigations conducted in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) framework. But neither the truth of this thesis nor its importance have become widely recognised in linguistics or anthropology. Influential scholars in both these fields continue to undermine the notion of the fundamental unity of humankind and to put total emphasis, instead, on the diversity of languages and cultures. As cross-linguistic investigations of the last fifty years show, however, despite the phenomenal diversity of human languages a shared “alphabet of human thoughts” was not just a figment of Leibniz’s imagination but a fitting metaphor for something real and immeasurably important. As the present article aims to show, “YOU” and “I” (“I” and “THOU”) are two twin cornerstones of this reality. To quote the entry on “Psychic unity of humankind” in the Encyclopedia of Anthropology, “Ineluctably, the idea [of a deep psychological unity of humankind] has ethical significance. For attempting to inform humans about what they are and what they have in common is not a neutral act” (Prono 2006). As the present article seeks to demonstrate (and as Martin Buber compellingly affirmed a century ago), “I” and “THOU” are an ineluctable part of who we are: how we think, how we speak and how we relate to others.","author":[{"family":"Wierzbicka","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"wierzbicka_2022_thou","container-title":"Russian Journal of Linguistics","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"908-936","source":"Zotero","title":"I and Thou: Universal human concepts present as words in all human languages","type":"article-journal","volume":"26"},

  {"id":"wikipedia_2022_spice","abstract":"A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, or other plant substance primarily used for flavoring or coloring food. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Spices are sometimes used in medicine, religious rituals, cosmetics or perfume production. For example, vanilla is commonly used as an ingredient in fragrance manufacturing.A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis. A fresh spice, such as ginger, is usually more flavorful than its dried form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life. Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example turmeric, and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form.\nAlthough health benefits are often claimed for spices, there is not currently not enough research conducted to prove these benefits.India contributes to 75% of global spice production. This is reflected culturally through their cuisine; historically, the spice trade developed throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as in East Asia and the Middle East. Europe's demand for spices was among the economic and cultural factors that encouraged exploration in the early modern period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Wikipedia","given":"Editors Of The"}],"citation-key":"wikipedia_2022_spice","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,19]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"note: Page Version ID: 1105333543","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Spice","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spice&oldid=1105333543"},

  {"id":"williams_2015_tequila","abstract":"With its unique aroma and heady buzz -- the perfect accompaniment to even the spiciest tacos -- tequila has won its way into drinkers' hearts worldwide. There are few places on earth besides Mexico that have the climate and terrain to evolve the agave plant that makes tequila -- and there are even fewer people who have the patience to wait the seven years or more that it takes \"the tree of marvels\" to grow. In this book, Ian Williams presents a lively history of this potent and popular drink. Beginning with pulque, the drink fermented by the Mayans, Olmecs, and Aztecs and reserved for pregnant women and priests -- and their sacrifices -- he traces how the Mexicans distilled tequila and mezcal (mescal) and began its heady surge into global popularity. From twenty-year a??ejos to giggle-inducing margaritas to the bravado -- and regret -- of that round of shots, he offers a history as gripping as the drink itself. Williams visits countless tequila producers, distributors, and connoisseurs to tell the story of how tequila started in the agave lands of Mexico, became an icon of youthful inebriation, and developed, today, into a truly artisanal product drawing the most discerning drinkers. Peppered throughout are illustrations that capture tequila's Mexican heritage and commercial image. Including recipes for tequila-based cocktails, as well as advice on the buying, storing, tasting, and serving of tequila, this history will delight any beverage aficionado or anyone interested in the history of Mexico and its culinary riches.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"williams_2015_tequila","collection-title":"Edible","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78023-480-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"publisher":"Reaktion Books","publisher-place":"London","title":"Tequila: a global history","type":"book"},
  {"id":"williams_2016_exploring","abstract":"It is well known that nutritional intake can vary substantially as a function of demographic variables such as ethnicity and/or sex. Although a variety of factors are known to underlie the relationship between these demographic variables and nutritional intake, it is interesting to speculate that variation in food intake associated with ethnicity or sex may result, in part, from differences in the perceived taste of foods in these different populations. Thus, we initiated a study to evaluate taste responsiveness in different ethnic groups. Moreover, because of the known differences in taste responsiveness between males and females, analyses were stratified by sex. The ethnic groups tested differed significantly from one another in reported perceived taste intensity. Our results showed that Hispanics and African Americans rated taste sensations higher than non-Hispanic Whites and that these differences were more pronounced in males. Understanding the nature of these differences in taste perception is important, because taste perception may contribute to dietary health risk. When attempting to modify diet, individuals of different ethnicities may require personalized interventions that take into account the different sensory experience that these individuals may have when consuming foods.","author":[{"family":"Williams","given":"Johnny A."},{"family":"Bartoshuk","given":"Linda M."},{"family":"Fillingim","given":"Roger B."},{"family":"Dotson","given":"Cedrick D."}],"citation-key":"williams_2016_exploring","container-title":"Chemical Senses","DOI":"10.1093/chemse/bjw021","ISSN":"0379-864X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"page":"449-456","title":"Exploring Ethnic Differences in Taste Perception","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjw021","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"wilson_2008_swindled","abstract":"From the Publisher: Bad food has a history. Swindled tells it. Through a fascinating mixture of cultural and scientific history, food politics, and culinary detective work, Bee Wilson uncovers the many ways swindlers have cheapened, falsified, and even poisoned our food throughout history. In the hands of people and corporations who have prized profits above the health of consumers, food and drink have been tampered with in often horrifying ways-padded, diluted, contaminated, substituted, mislabeled, misnamed, or otherwise faked. Swindled gives a panoramic view of this history, from the leaded wine of the ancient Romans to today's food frauds-such as fake organics and the scandal of Chinese babies being fed bogus milk powder. Wilson pays special attention to nineteenth-and twentieth-century America and England and their roles in developing both industrial-scale food adulteration and the scientific ability to combat it. As Swindled reveals, modern science has both helped and hindered food fraudsters-increasing the sophistication of scams but also the means to detect them. The big breakthrough came in Victorian England when a scientist first put food under the microscope and found that much of what was sold as genuine coffee was anything but-and that you couldn't buy pure mustard in all of London. Arguing that industrialization, laissez-faire politics, and globalization have all hurt the quality of food, but also that food swindlers have always been helped by consumer ignorance, Swindled ultimately calls for both governments and individuals to be more vigilant.

Winchester's gift for capturing engaging characters in true, compelling stories provides us with a treasury of enchanting and informed insight on the culture, language, history, and politics of this little-known corner of Asia.

In 1225 the Tran family overthrew the last emperor of the previous dynasty, the Ly (1009–1225) and hitherto the only long lived one. The Ly imperial line, in fact, lasted nearly fifty years longer than its successor. Nevertheless, the Tran is unquestionably the most renowned of all Vietnamese dynasties on account of its victories when Kubilai Khan's armies attacked three times in the thirteenth century. Yet one has to ask what kind of dynasty it was and how the country it ruled should be defined. Should one look to China, the source of the dynastic institution, for guidance or should one look elsewhere? An event in 1237 suggests ambiguity. That year officials were required to offer betel and tea to the emperor when he was departing from the Eastern Pier near the capital. “Betel and tea” bring Southeast Asia as well as China into the picture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolters","given":"O.

  {"id":"wright_2007_medieval","abstract":"The medieval spice trade between the eleventh and the sixteenth centuries made Europe wealthy. Black pepper was the most important spice in this trade, and if it was most important because of its piquancy, and the evidence indicates as much, then the discovery of the chile (Capsicum annuum and spp.) would have been an ideal substitute for expensive spices from the East. The medieval spice did in fact decline dramatically about the same time as the discovery and diffusion of the chile. The question arises: did the arrival of the chile in the Old World contribute to or cause the decline in the spice trade? By reviewing the spice trade before the discovery of the New World, the Venetian-Mamluke monopoly on that trade, the role of the Portuguese and Dutch in the spice trade, and the European diffusion of the chile after 1492 this article will argue that the chile played no role in the diminishing of the spice trade and that the chile's arrival in Europe and the decline of the East-West spice trade appear to be coincidental and not causal.","author":[{"family":"Wright","given":"Clifford A."}],"citation-key":"wright_2007_medieval","container-title":"Gastronomica","DOI":"10.1525/gfc.2007.7.2.35","ISSN":"1529-3262","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007"]]},"page":"35-43","title":"The Medieval Spice Trade and the Diffusion of the Chile","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1525/gfc.2007.7.2.35","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"wu_2016_google","abstract":"Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference – sometimes prohibitively so in the case of very large data sets and large models. Several authors have also charged that NMT systems lack robustness, particularly when input sentences contain rare words. These issues have hindered NMT’s use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google’s Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using residual connections as well as attention connections from the decoder network to the encoder. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the ﬁnal translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units (“wordpieces”) for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the ﬂexibility of “character”-delimited models and the eﬃciency of “word”-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. To directly optimize the translation BLEU scores, we consider reﬁning the models by using reinforcement learning, but we found that the improvement in the BLEU scores did not reﬂect in the human evaluation. On the WMT’14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60% compared to Google’s phrase-based production system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Yonghui"},{"family":"Schuster","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhifeng"},{"family":"Le","given":"Quoc V."},{"family":"Norouzi","given":"Mohammad"},{"family":"Macherey","given":"Wolfgang"},{"family":"Krikun","given":"Maxim"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Yuan"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Macherey","given":"Klaus"},{"family":"Klingner","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Apurva"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Melvin"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiaobing"},{"family":"Kaiser","given":"Łukasz"},{"family":"Gouws","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Yoshikiyo"},{"family":"Kudo","given":"Taku"},{"family":"Kazawa","given":"Hideto"},{"family":"Stevens","given":"Keith"},{"family":"Kurian","given":"George"},{"family":"Patil","given":"Nishant"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Young","given":"Cliff"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Riesa","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Rudnick","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Vinyals","given":"Oriol"},{"family":"Corrado","given":"Greg"},{"family":"Hughes","given":"Macduff"},{"family":"Dean","given":"Jeffrey"}],"citation-key":"wu_2016_google","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1609.08144","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,8]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:1609.08144","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Google's Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation","title-short":"Google's Neural Machine Translation System","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144"},

  {"id":"wu_2020_computerassisted","abstract":"Historical language comparison opens windows onto a human past, long before the availability of written records. Since traditional language comparison within the framework of the comparative method is largely based on manual data comparison, requiring the meticulous sifting through dictionaries, word lists, and grammars, the framework is difficult to apply, especially in times where more and more data have become available in digital form. Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply automate the process of historical language comparison, not only because computational solutions lag behind human judgments in historical linguistics, but also because they lack the flexibility that would allow them to integrate various types of information from various kinds of sources. A more promising approach is to integrate computational and classical approaches within a 'computer-assisted framework', “neither completely computer-driven nor ignorant of the assistance computers afford” [1, p. 4]. In this paper, we will illustrate what we consider the current state of the art of computer-assisted language comparison by presenting a workflow that starts with raw data and leads up to a stage where sound correspondence patterns across multiple languages have been identified and can be readily presented, inspected, and discussed. We illustrate this workflow with the help of a newly prepared dataset on Hmong-Mien languages. Our illustration is accompanied by Python code and instructions on how to use additional web-based tools we developed so that users can apply our workflow for their own purposes.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Mei-Shin"},{"family":"Schweikhard","given":"Nathanael E."},{"family":"Bodt","given":"Timotheus A."},{"family":"Hill","given":"Nathan W."},{"family":"List","given":"Johann-Mattis"}],"citation-key":"wu_2020_computerassisted","container-title":"Journal of Open Humanities Data","DOI":"10.5334/johd.12","ISSN":"2059-481X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"2","title":"Computer-Assisted Language Comparison: State of the Art","type":"Journal Article","volume":"6"},

Compared with European languages, non-European languages are never major sources of word borrowing in English, with Chinese staying even more peripheral. Scholars have recorded no more than a few hundred English words of Chinese origin. This, however, does not make it easier to study the etymology and semantics of Chinese loanwords. The complication arises from the various source dialects from which Chinese words were borrowed (Mandarin, Cantonese, Amoy, Hokkien, etc.) and also from transcription processes, in which Chinese logograms are ‘romanised’ into phonetic representations so as to be readable for English speakers. It is a procedure easily affected by the transcribers' own cognition and the transcription systems employed, and the arbitrariness of the above variables contributes much to the fact that the orthography of Chinese loanwords, especially those entering the English language early, are prone to changes. This article aims to shed some light on how the ways of transcription may affect the spelling of Chinese loanwords.","author":[{"family":"Wu","given":"Zhen"}],"citation-key":"wu_2020_early","container-title":"English Today","DOI":"10.1017/S0266078419000208","ISSN":"0266-0784","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"23-29","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","title":"Early Mandarin Loanwords in Contemporary English: The Influence of Transcription Systems on Orthography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/article/early-mandarin-loanwords-in-contemporary-english/DED6DECEB487E38C2825ADB31ADEB79C","volume":"36"},

Zanthoxylum bungeanum and Z. armatum are both commonly recognized as Szechuan peppers, but they have different tastes and effects. The chemical components, genetic characteristics, and suitable habitat of six cultivars were analyzed in this study. The results indicated that Z. armatum contained a larger proportion of volatile oil, whereas Z. bungeanum produced a more non-volatile ether extraction. The average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. armatum were 11.84 and 11.63%, respectively, and the average content of volatile oil and non-volatile ether extract of Z. bungeanum were 6.46 and 14.23%, respectively. Combined with an internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence characters and chemical PCA results, six cultivars were classiﬁed into their own groups, for the two species in particular. The temperature in January and July were the most signiﬁcant ecological factors inﬂuencing the contents of the Z. armatum volatile oil. However, annual precipitation, temperature in January and relevant humidity had a signiﬁcant positive correlation with the content of non-volatile ether extract in Z. bungeanum. Thus, the most suitable areas for producing Z. bungeanum cultivars ranged from the Hengduan Mountains to the Ta-pa Mountains, and the regions suitable for Z. armatum cultivars were found to be in the Sichuan Basin and Dalou-Wu mountains. The predicted suitable habitat could be used as a preliminary test area for Szechuan pepper cultivar production.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Xiang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yue"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Caixiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiwen"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Yadong"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Shilin"}],"citation-key":"xiang_2016_chemical","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","container-title-short":"Front.

Island ports and island cities represented key sites of water-facilitated transport and exchange in the ancient Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Building our analysis upon a historical overview of the ancient Maritime Silk Road from the perspective of China’s Guangdong Province and the city of Guangzhou, we envision a millennia-long ‘Silk Road Archipelago’ encompassing island cities and island territories stretching across East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Asia, and East Africa. Bearing in mind the complex movements of peoples, places, and processes involved, we conceptualise the ancient Maritime Silk Road as an uncentred network of archipelagic relation. This conceptualisation of the ancient Maritime Silk Road as a vast archipelago can have relevance for our understanding of China’s present-day promotion of a 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road as part of the Belt and Road Initiative. We ultimately argue against forcing the Maritime Silk Road concept within a binary perspective of essentialised East-West conflict or hierarchical relations and instead argue for the value of a nuanced understanding of relationality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Xie","given":"Baoxia"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xianlong"},{"family":"Grydehøj","given":"Adam"}],"citation-key":"xie_2020_perceiving","container-title":"Island Studies Journal","container-title-short":"ISJ","DOI":"10.24043/isj.118","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"55-72","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perceiving the Silk Road Archipelago: Archipelagic relations within the ancient and 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road","title-short":"Perceiving the Silk Road Archipelago","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://islandstudiesjournal.org/files/ISJXieArchipelagoRelationalitySilkRoad.pdf","volume":"15"},

In terms of synaesthetic metaphor, BITTERNESS is more versatile than PAIN, as the former can be transferred to more sensory domains than the latter. Regardless of the sensory domains, the synaesthetic metaphor basically inherits the negative polarity in both Chinese and English. Regarding conceptual metaphor, both BITTERNESS and PAIN exhibit noticeable cross-linguistic differences. Specifically, EFFORT IS BITTERNESS and INTENSITY IS PAIN are attested in Chinese, while EFFORT IS PAIN and INTENSITY IS BITTERNESS are in operation in English. Whenever EFFORT is targeted, the expression at issue obliterates the negative sense of BITTER and PAIN, probably because the concept of “effort” is cross-culturally positive.","author":[{"family":"Xiong","given":"Jiajuan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"xiong_2015_being","container-title":"Chinese Lexical Semantics CLSW 2015: Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol. 9332","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-319-27194-1_2","editor":[{"family":"Lu","given":"Qin"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Helena Hong"}],"ISBN":"978-3-319-27194-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"page":"15-23","publisher":"Springer, Cham","title":"Being Assiduous: Do We Have BITTERNESS or PAIN?","type":"Conference Proceedings"},
  {"id":"xiong_2016_synaesthetic","abstract":"This paper investigates the non-gustatory uses of the gustatory word ણ wei ‘taste’ in Chinese Buddhist texts, in particular, in the Āgamas. The non-gustatory uses of ણ wei ‘taste’ basically fall into two categories: the synaesthetic category and the metaphorical category. The former features the use of ણ wei ‘taste’ as an umbrella sensory term which can collocate with all the other sensory words, whereas the latter shows that ણ wei ‘taste’ can modify abstract and sublime Buddhist terms, such as ⌅ fa ‘dhamma’ and 䀓㝛 jietuo ‘enlightenment’, for the sake of concretization. These two categories of uses have one sense in common: the sense of “pleasure and joy”, which can be interpreted in both mundane and supra-mundane levels, depending on the context. Moreover, we find that the versatile uses of ણ wei ‘taste’ are most likely to be influenced by its equivalent in the Pāli Buddhist texts. This finding sheds light on the history of Chinese language development, specifically, how Chinese language has been influenced by Buddhist text translation.","author":[{"family":"Xiong","given":"Jiajuan"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"xiong_2016_synaesthetic","container-title":"PACLIC30 Proceedings","event-place":"Seoul, Korea","event-title":"30th Pacific Asia Conference onLanguage, Information and Computation (PACLIC 30)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","publisher-place":"Seoul, Korea","title":"The Synaesthetic and Metaphorical Uses of 味 wei ‘taste’ in Chinese Buddhist Texts","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"yan_2008_zhongguogudaizhiwuxiangliaoshengchan","abstract":"我国是一个历史悠久的文明古国,文化遗产积淀丰厚,香文化源远流长,在香料生产与利用方面积累了大量的技术经验,香料贸易则是我国古代朝贡贸易的重要组成部分,对当时的社会生活产生了深远影响。传统香料按来源划分,可分为动物香料和植物香料,动物香料只有麝香（Musk）、灵猫香（civet）、海狸香（Castoreum）、龙涎香（Ambergris）四种,而植物香料到目前为止被发现的有五百种左右。植物香料在人们起居生活中无所不在,其气味芳香、性质独特,在薰香、美容化妆、饮食调味、医药保健、宗教祭祀等方面应用广泛,作用无可替代。但迄今为止,相关的专题研究非常稀少,研究成果寥若晨星。中国古代植物香料的生产、利用与贸易问题值得全面探讨和深入研究。本论文首先对中国古代主要香料植物的种类、性状和地理分布进行简要介绍。这些最常见的香料植物主要有沉香、乳香、檀香、松香、甘草、白芷、豆蔻、胡椒、花椒、藿香、薄荷、排草香、薰衣草、茉莉、玫瑰、姜、韭、葱、蒜等。芳香植物按其取材部位,可分为树脂类、芳香花草类、香材类、果类和根茎类香料;按其功用,可分为香辛蔬菜与调味类、药用保健类和香化环境类;按其产地,可分为本土香料植物和外来香料植物;按其加工后的形态,又可分为原态香材、线香、篾香、盘香、香丸、香粉、香膏、香汤、香脑油等。不同香料植物的性状各不相同,地理分布也存在明显的地域差异,本文在对其进行简要介绍的同时,为了更清晰展示其全貌,将全国分为华东、华南、华北、西南、西北、东北等六个地区,利用图表形式展示古代文献中有关香料植物的性状和地理分布的原始记录。中国古代植物香料的栽培、加工和贮藏历史悠久。本论文主要从中国古代的农业技术角度,探讨香辛蔬菜、调味料和薰香料等芳香植物的栽培方法。早在《诗经》时代,人们就已经掌握了一些野生香辛植物引进园圃进行栽培和改良的相关技术,培育出葱、姜、蒜、韭、薤、桂、椒、蒿、芷、香橼等多种本土香料。其栽培方法主要有选种、下种、移植、压条、扦插,详细说明古人在生产生活实践中,栽培香辛蔬菜和调味料技术已呈现多样化趋势。同时,他们也懂得将茉莉、排草香、水仙、柑橘、土沉香等薰香料类芳香植物的越冬防寒技术,其主要有室内盆栽保暖和以土培根等。总的来说,我国古代香料植物的人工栽培规模大小不一,以小规模的园圃形式为主。另外,土沉香是古代中国特有的树脂类薰香料,因其自然资源稀少,且只能在气候温暖湿润的岭南一些地区的沙质土壤中生长,所以,只有依靠人工栽培才能满足需求,但栽培环境要求严格,所以文中对其人工栽培问题还特书一笔。栽培并出售香料植物获得经济来源是一些古人的谋生手段之一,虽然在不同的历史时期和地域,这一谋生手段的地位和作用存在差别,但本文对这一问题也给予了简要的论述,在于强调我国古代百姓贾农,为了谋生而从事植物香料生产经营的经济目的。先人们在植物香料的加工、贮藏方面手段多样,并积累了丰富的经验,且相关技术日趋成熟,值得我们研究和借鉴。总体上讲,我国古代植物香料的加工炮制方法主要有水制、火制和水火合制三种。其中,水制又可分为洗、漂、泡、渍、水飞等;火制包括煅、炮、煨、炒、烘、焙、炙等;水火合制主要有蒸、煮、淬等。在古代中国,植物香料的贮藏方法多种多样,可谓举不胜举。限于论文篇幅,本研究只对龙脑香、柑橘、姜等几种薰香料、香果与香蔬的贮藏方法作重点介绍,并着重对其保鲜防腐、防治蠹虫、防止香味散失等加工、贮藏技术进行梳理。最后交待了中国古代宫廷与民间制香的发展历程。中国古代植物香料的利用历时悠远,途径多种,影响深远,意义重大。有关这一问题,本文着重探讨以下几个方面的问题:植物香料与中国古代的薰香、美容、饮食、医疗、保健和宗教祭祀。在薰香生活中,利用植物香料制作的薰香料扮演着举足轻重的角色,一直受到重视。文中首先追溯了中国古代薰香的历史渊源,接着分别着重叙述了隋、唐、五代、宋、元、明、清时期薰香的发展过程;在此基础上,对我国古代植物香料与传统制香业特别是是宫廷贵族的薰香调配、制作、使用作了概括性介绍,凸现植物香料在宫廷生活中的重要地位。同时,介绍了历代薰香料（合香）的调配与制作技术,利用玉片、银叶、砂片、云母等进行隔火薰香的方法,薰香炉具的品种、款式、质地与使用方法的演变等。中国古代香妆品有着悠久的历史,远在三千多年前的夏、商时期,就有了利用芳香植物美容化妆的文献记载。古代香妆品的主要成份来自于天然香料植物,所以,植物香料与中国古代美容化妆关系密切。针对这一问题,文章首先全面阐述了中国古代香妆品使用的大致发展历程,其结论是:先秦时期粉和胭脂的一般利用,南北朝时期寿阳妆、红妆的出现与流行,隋唐时期化妆技术成熟,盛装和浓妆是这一时期的特点,宋元时期流行淡雅、含蓄面妆,明清时期香精提炼技术成熟,香妆品的品种开始繁多。最后,分别介绍中国古代口脂、面脂、胭脂、香粉、藻豆、香泽、香露和眉黛等各种香妆品的使用与制作,从美白、去斑、去皱、润肤等角度,专门探讨独具特色的中国古代医学芳香美容,为我国现代美容技术的发展提供历史借鉴。植物香料与中国古代饮食、医药、宗教祭祀等活动密不可分,饮食、薰香、化妆、医药、宗教祭祀是植物香料的主要功能。笔者为此着重探讨三个方面的问题:一是植物香料与中国古代饮食之间的关系。主要包括植物香料在烹饪调味、香茶加工利用、香酒加工利用过程中利用;二是植物香料在中国古代医药保健中的作用。上古时期,先民在顺应自然、改造自然的活动中,凭藉观其形、闻其气和尝其味,在长期实践过程中,逐渐认识到自然界中一些芳香植物的医药保健作用,这些具有医药功能的芳香植物也就是香药。香药以其令人愉快的气味被先民所喜欢,又因其独特的药用效果为先民所利用,辛、温、热是古人对香药性质的根本认识。古代医家甚至把香药特别划为一个门类列入其著作当中,成为先民最早认识并广泛用之于临床的中药。本文主要论述了“香药”利用的历史沿革,包括古人对香料植物制作的香药性状的认识、利用和加工炮制,以及香药在医疗保健中的利用等一系列问题;三是植物香料在古代各种形式的祭祀活动中扮演的角色。在宗教中,“香”自古被认为具有通达上天的作用,是神灵的使者。本研究主要探讨了古代祭天祀祖、佛教和道教仪式中植物香料的使用情况。为了寻求政治、军事和贸易保护,古代很多邻邦奉强盛的中国为宗主国,派使者携带香料、象牙等物品来到中国进献给朝廷。有时地方政府为取悦于朝廷也会向朝廷进献特产香料。香料是中国古代域外和各级地方政府的主要朝贡品,在中国古代的朝贡贸易中担当着重要角色,有时甚至起着其它物品不可替代的作用。通过朝贡而来的域外植物香料,扩大了中国古代植物香料的来源,增加了植物香料的品种,对这一问题的探讨,有助于我们进一步了解中国古代植物香料与域外植物香料之间的关系。对各个历史时期地方政府向朝廷进献植物香料行为的研究,也有助于我们扩大了解中国古代本土植物香料的一些情况。为了便于研究中国古代香料的朝贡贸易问题,笔者把中国古代分为五个时段,分别探讨了魏晋南北朝及其以前、隋唐五代、宋元、明、清时期的香料朝贡贸易,分析香料朝贡贸易的原因、实质与作用,研究香料朝贡贸易的影响,尤其注重对宋代、明代和清代的香料朝贡贸易问题进行研究,分析在各自的历史背景下香料朝贡贸易的原因及其对中国古代政治、经济、文化和社会生活等产生的影响。毋庸讳言,尽管在本论文在撰写过程中,笔者广泛地搜集资料,进行了多方位的研究和探讨,由于资料、时间和个人水平等因素,文章存在不足甚至舛误之处在所难免,如对植物香料的种类和地理分布阐述不够系统全面,对植物香料的利用问题探讨有待于深入,对中国古代香料朝贡贸易问题分析还不十分透彻,等等。期望本研究能够弥补学界研究之不足、拓展科技史研究范围,给当今香料、香精、化妆品产业提供历史借鉴和参考,为继承和发展中国古代“香文化遗产”尽绵薄之力。my country is an ancient civilization with a long history, rich in cultural heritage, and a long history of incense culture. It has accumulated a lot of technical experience in the production and utilization of spices. The spice trade is an important part of the ancient tribute trade in my country. had a profound impact. Traditional spices can be divided into animal spices and plant spices according to their sources. Animal spices are only musk (Musk), civet (civet), castoreum (Castoreum), and ambergris (Ambergris). About 500 species have been discovered. Plant spices are ubiquitous in people's daily life, with their aromatic smell and unique properties, they are widely used in aromatherapy, beauty and makeup, food seasoning, medicine and health care, religious sacrifices, etc., and their role is irreplaceable. But so far, the relevant special researches are very rare, and the research results are few and far between. The production, utilization and trade of ancient Chinese plant spices are worthy of comprehensive discussion and in-depth research. This paper first briefly introduces the types, characters and geographical distribution of the main spice plants in ancient China. These most common spice plants mainly include agarwood, frankincense, sandalwood, rosin, licorice, angelica dahurica, cardamom, pepper, pepper, patchouli, mint, herbal incense, lavender, jasmine, rose, ginger, leek, onion, garlic, etc. Aromatic plants can be divided into resins, aromatic flowers and plants, aromatic materials, fruits and rhizome spices according to their parts; according to their functions, they can be divided into spicy vegetables and seasoning, medicinal health care and aroma environment; According to its place of origin, it can be divided into local spice plants and exotic spice plants; according to its processed form, it can be divided into original incense materials, incense sticks, stick incense, coil incense, incense pills, incense powder, balm, incense Soup, peppermint oil, etc. The traits of different spice plants are different, and there are obvious regional differences in geographical distribution. In this paper, while briefly introducing them, in order to show their overall picture more clearly, the whole country is divided into East China, South China, North China, Southwest China, Northwest China and Northeast China. The original records of the traits and geographical distribution of spice plants in ancient literature were displayed in the form of diagrams. The cultivation, processing and storage of ancient Chinese plant spices have a long history. This paper mainly discusses the cultivation methods of aromatic plants such as spicy vegetables, seasonings and incense from the perspective of ancient Chinese agricultural technology. As early as the \"Book of Songs\" era, people have mastered the related technologies of introducing some wild spice plants into gardens for cultivation and improvement, and cultivated onion, ginger, garlic, leek, scallion, osmanthus, pepper, artemisia, zhi, citron, etc. native spices. Its cultivation methods mainly include seed selection, sowing, transplanting, layering, and cuttings. In detail, in the production and life practice of the ancients, the cultivation of spicy vegetables and seasoning techniques has shown a trend of diversification. At the same time, they also know the overwintering and cold protection techniques of aromatic plants such as jasmine, paicaoxiang, narcissus, citrus, and agarwood, which mainly include indoor potted plants to keep warm and soil bacon. Generally speaking, the artificial cultivation scales of spice plants in ancient my country vary, mainly in the form of small-scale gardens. In addition, agarwood is a unique resinous incense in ancient China. Because of the scarcity of natural resources, it can only grow in sandy soil in some areas in the south of the Five Ridges with a warm and humid climate. Therefore, only artificial cultivation can meet the demand, but cultivation The environmental requirements are strict, so there is a special book about its artificial cultivation in this paper. Cultivating and selling spice plants to obtain economic resources is one of the means of livelihood of some ancient people. Although the status and function of this means of livelihood are different in different historical periods and regions, this article also gives a brief discussion on this issue. It is to emphasize the economic purpose of Jia Nong, a common man in ancient my country, engaged in the production and management of plant spices in order to make a living. The ancestors have various methods in the processing and storage of plant spices, and have accumulated rich experience, and the related technologies are becoming more and more mature, which is worthy of our study and reference. Generally speaking, there are three main methods of processing plant spices in ancient my country: water, fire and water-fire combination. Among them, the water system can be divided into washing, bleaching, soaking, soaking, water flying, etc.; the fire system includes calcining, firing, simmering, frying, baking, roasting, broiling, etc.; In ancient China, there were various storage methods for plant spices, which can be described as too numerous to mention. Due to the limited length of the paper, this study only focuses on the storage methods of dipterocarp, citrus, ginger and other spices, fragrant fruits and fragrant vegetables, and focuses on the processing and storage of fresh-keeping and antisepsis, silverfish control, and fragrance loss prevention. technology sorting out. Finally, the development process of ancient Chinese court and folk incense making is explained. The utilization of plant spices in ancient China has a long history and various ways, with far-reaching influence and great significance. Regarding this issue, this article focuses on the following aspects: plant spices and ancient Chinese incense, beauty, diet, medical treatment, health care and religious sacrifices. In the incense life, the incense made of plant spices plays a pivotal role and has always been valued. This article first traces the historical origin of incense in ancient my country, and then focuses on the development process of incense in Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties; The incense industry, especially the incense blending, production and use of the court nobles, is given a general introduction, highlighting the important position of plant spices in court life. At the same time, it introduces the blending and production technology of incense (hexiang) in the past dynasties, the method of using jade flakes, silver leaves, sand flakes, mica, etc. evolution etc. Ancient Chinese fragrances and cosmetics have a long history. As far back as the Xia and Shang dynasties more than 3,000 years ago, there have been records of using aromatic plants for beauty and makeup. The main ingredients of ancient cosmetics come from natural spice plants, so plant spices are closely related to ancient Chinese beauty and makeup. In response to this problem, the article first comprehensively expounds the general development process of the use of ancient Chinese cosmetics. The conclusions are: the general use of powder and rouge in the pre-Qin period, the appearance and popularity of Shouyang makeup and red makeup in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the makeup technology in the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Maturity, costumes and heavy makeup are the characteristics of this period. Elegant and subtle facial makeup was popular in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. In the Ming and Qing Dynasties, the essence extraction technology was mature, and the varieties of fragrance cosmetics began to increase. Finally, it introduces the use and production of ancient Chinese cosmetics such as lip balm, face balm, rouge, face powder, algae beans, fragrance, fragrance dew and eyebrow cream, from whitening, freckle removal, wrinkle removal, skin moisturizing, etc. From the angle of view, it specifically discusses the unique ancient Chinese medical aroma cosmetology, and provides historical reference for the development of modern cosmetology technology in our country. Plant spices are inseparable from ancient Chinese diet, medicine, religious sacrifices and other activities. Diet, aromatherapy, makeup, medicine, and religious sacrifices are the main functions of plant spices. The author focuses on three aspects: one is the relationship between plant spices and ancient Chinese diet. It mainly includes the use of plant spices in cooking seasoning, processing and utilization of fragrant tea, and processing and utilization of fragrant wine; the second is the role of plant spices in ancient Chinese medicine and health care. In ancient times, in the activities of conforming to and transforming nature, the ancestors gradually realized the medical and health functions of some aromatic plants in nature by observing their shape, smelling their breath and tasting their taste. Functional aromatic plants are also fragrant medicines. Aromatic medicine was liked by the ancestors for its pleasant smell, and was used by the ancestors because of its unique medicinal effect. Pungent, warm and hot are the basic understanding of the properties of fragrant medicine by the ancients. Ancient physicians even classified fragrant medicine as a special category and included it in their works, which became the earliest traditional Chinese medicine recognized by the ancestors and widely used in clinical practice. This paper mainly discusses the historical evolution of the utilization of \"fragrant medicine\", including a series of issues such as the ancients' understanding, utilization and processing of aromatic medicines made from spice plants, and the use of fragrant medicines in medical care; the third is the use of plant spices in The role played in various forms of sacrificial activities in ancient times. In religion, \"fragrance\" has been believed to have the function of reaching the heavens since ancient times, and is the messenger of the gods. This study mainly explores the use of plant spices in ancient rituals of offering sacrifices to heaven and ancestors, Buddhism and Taoism. In order to seek political, military and trade protection, many neighboring countries in ancient times regarded the powerful China as their suzerain, and sent envoys to China with spices, ivory and other items to present to the imperial court. Sometimes local governments will also offer special spices to the imperial court in order to please the imperial court. Spices were the main tribute products of foreign and local governments in ancient China. They played an important role in the tribute trade in ancient China, and sometimes even played an irreplaceable role for other items. The extraterritorial plant spices brought by tribute have expanded the source of ancient Chinese plant spices and increased the variety of plant spices. The discussion of this issue will help us further understand the relationship between ancient Chinese plant spices and extraterritorial plant spices. . The research on the behavior of local governments donating plant spices to the imperial court in various historical periods will also help us to expand our understanding of some of the local plant spices in ancient China. In order to facilitate the study of the tribute trade of spices in ancient China, the author divides ancient China into five periods, respectively discussing the tribute trade of spices in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties and before, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, and analyzing the spice tribute trade. The reasons, substance and function of the spice tributary trade are studied, and the influence of the spice tribute trade is studied, especially focusing on the study of the spice tribute trade in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties, and the reasons for the spice tribute trade in their respective historical backgrounds and their influence on ancient Chinese politics, economic, cultural and social life. Needless to say, although the author extensively collected materials and conducted multi-faceted research and discussions during the writing process of this paper, due to factors such as data, time and personal level, it is inevitable that the article has deficiencies or even mistakes, such as The types and geographical distribution of plant spices are not described systematically and comprehensively, the utilization of plant spices needs to be further explored, the analysis of the tribute trade of spices in ancient China is not very thorough, and so on. It is hoped that this study can make up for the lack of academic research, expand the scope of research on the history of science and technology, provide historical reference and reference for today's spices, flavors, and cosmetics industries, and contribute to the inheritance and development of ancient Chinese \"fragrance cultural heritage\".","archive":"CNKI","author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Xiaoqing"}],"citation-key":"yan_2008_zhongguogudaizhiwuxiangliaoshengchan","contributor":[{"literal":"严小青"}],"event-place":"Nanjing","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"publisher":"Nanjing Agricultural University","publisher-place":"Nanjing","title":"中国古代植物香料生产、利用与贸易研究 [The Study of Armoatic Plant on Production, Utilization and Trade in Ancient China]","type":"thesis","URL":"https://chn.oversea.cnki.net/KCMS/detail/detail.aspx?dbcode=CDFD&dbname=CDFDLAST2015&filename=2009076970.nh&uniplatform=OVERSEA&v=KWl8ifoJDTjIpdXHuCMxZoOvb5SI4AGjsl4qSkP7QvJTOl6dN--NCfNJod0coioU"},

The Singapore Historical Geographic Information System (SHGIS) and the Singapore Biographical Database (SBDB) are expandable WebGIS platforms gathering and linking data on cultural and religious networks across Southeast Asia. This inter-connected platform can be expanded to cover not only Singapore but all of Southeast Asia. We have added layers of data that go beyond Chinese Taoist, Buddhist, and popular god temples to also display the distributions of a wide range of other religious networks, including Christian churches, Islamic mosques, Hindu temples, and Theravadin, which are the Taiwanese, Japanese and Tibetan Buddhist monasteries found across the region. This digital platform covers a larger area than the Taiwan History and Culture in Time and Space (THCTS) historical GIS platform but is more regionally focused than the ECAI (Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative) By incorporating Chinese inscriptions, extensive surveys of Chinese temples and associations, as well as archival and historical sources, this platform provides new materials and new perspectives on the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia. This paper: (1) outlines key research questions underlying these digital humanities platforms; (2) describes the overall architecture and the kinds of data included in the SHGIS and the SBDB; (3) reviews past research on historical GIS; and provides (4) a discussion of how incorporating Chinese epigraphy of Southeast Asia into these websites can help scholars trace networks across the entire region, potentially enabling comparative work on a wide range of religious networks in the region. Part 5 of the paper outlines technical aspects of the WebGIS platform.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Yan","given":"Yingwei"},{"family":"Dean","given":"Kenneth"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Chen-Chieh"},{"family":"Hue","given":"Guan Thye"},{"family":"Koh","given":"Khee-heong"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Lily"},{"family":"Ong","given":"Chang Woei"},{"family":"Tay","given":"Arthur"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yi-chen"},{"family":"Xue","given":"Yiran"}],"citation-key":"yan_2020_chinese","container-title":"Religions","container-title-short":"Religions","DOI":"10.3390/rel11070334","ISSN":"2077-1444","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,6]]},"language":"en","page":"334","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chinese temple networks in Southeast Asia: A WebGIS digital humanities platform for the collaborative study of the Chinese diaspora in Southeast Asia","title-short":"Chinese temple networks in southeast asia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/11/7/334","volume":"11"},

This is demonstrated through close analysis of the political rhetoric surrounding Tang relations with neighboring steppe or Central Asian powers during the periods 625–645 and 734–739, with particular attention to contextualizing the rhetoric of the emperors Taizong and Xuanzong. The essay also presents a new interpretation of the famous 630 debate over the resettlement of the Eastern Tu¨ rks, arguing that the rhetoric of perfidy, loyalty, and moral or cultural transformation in which that debate was conducted obscures its origin in a pragmatic strategic dilemma that could not be openly expressed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Shao-yun"}],"citation-key":"yang_2013_what","container-title":"Tang Studies","container-title-short":"Tang Studies","DOI":"10.1179/0737503413Z.0000000008","ISSN":"0737-5034, 1759-7633","issue":"31","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",12]]},"language":"en","page":"28-74","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"“What Do Barbarians Know of Gratitude?” — the Stereotype of Barbarian Perfidy and Its Uses in Tang Foreign Policy Rhetoric","title-short":"“What Do Barbarians Know of Gratitude?","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0737503413Z.0000000008","volume":"2013"},

Attempts to censure or prosecute the generals responsible were rare and usually overruled, because military morale was seen as a higher priority than discipline or humaneness. Tang generals were also authorized to massacre surrendered enemy soldiers and conquered civilians for a range of strategic purposes. Moreover, taking slaves from a defeated population was a common prerogative among generals and officers even when an army was not “let loose.” When generals refrained from pillage, massacres, and enslavement, therefore, this was usually for reasons that were pragmatic and strategic, not moral or legal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Shao-yun"}],"citation-key":"yang_2017_letting","container-title":"Journal of Chinese Military History","container-title-short":"J Chin Mil Hist","DOI":"10.1163/22127453-12341307","ISSN":"2212-7445, 2212-7453","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5,31]]},"language":"en","page":"1-52","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Letting the Troops Loose: Pillage, Massacres, and Enslavement in Early Tang Warfare","title-short":"Letting the Troops Loose","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/jcmh/6/1/article-p1_1.xml","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"yaniv_2014_medicinal","abstract":"Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) have accompanied mankind from its very early beginnings. Their utilization has co-evolved with homo sapiens itself. Evolution has brought about a profound increase in our scientific knowledge about these species, so that, to date, they find utilization in many facets of our life (eg. pharmaceutical products, feed- and food additives, cosmetics, etc.). Remarkably today, despite the new renaissance of MAPs usage, ca. 80 % of the world's population relies upon natural substances of plant origin, with most of these botanicals sourced from the wild state. This huge increase in demand has put an unparalleled large burden on the natural resources of MAPs endangering their existence. The first volume of the series Medicinal Plants of the World, will briefly summarize the most essential current scientific knowledge about the sustainable sourcing of botanicals from both wild-crafting and cultivation. In these 21 chapters, eminent researchers of the topic will summarize latest scientific knowledge from the versatile and most varied scientific disciplines involved: botany, phytochemistry, plant breeding, biotechnology, agrotechnology, mechanization and economics. Individual chapters will deal with the essentials of phytomedical utilization, as well as utilization in the form of animal feed-additives. The volume concludes with a chapter on the poisonous MAPs in our homes, offices and modern everyday environments. The aim of this volume is to offer basic scientific information on MAPs. It will also enable readers of subsequent volumes to digest and interpret the other volumes in the series, that will deal with important and characteristic wild-crafted and cultivated MAPs of the different geographic and climatic regions of the world. Thus, the series is meant to be a storehouse of up-to-date information on our global wealth of medicinal and aromatic plants on the basis of which MAPs will be collected, cultivated, traded and utilized in a sustainable way.","citation-key":"yaniv_2014_medicinal","collection-title":"Medicinal and Aromatic Plants of the World","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-017-9276-9","editor":[{"family":"Yaniv","given":"Zohara"},{"family":"Dudai","given":"Nativ"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-017-9275-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","title":"Medicinal and aromatic plants of the Middle-East","type":"book"},

The ratings for all variables were collected with 9-point Likert scales. We tested the reliability of the present database by comparing it to the extant Chinese Affective Word System, and performed splithalf correlations for all six variables. We then evaluated the relationships between all variables. Regarding the affective variables, we found a typical quadratic relation between valence and arousal, in line with previous findings. Likewise, significant correlations were found between the semantic variables. Importantly, we explored the relationships between ratings for the affective variables (i.e., valence and arousal) and concreteness ratings, suggesting that valence and arousal ratings can predict concreteness ratings. This database of affective norms will be a valuable source of information for emotion research that makes use of Chinese words, and will enable researchers to use highly controlled Chinese verbal stimuli to more reliably investigate the relation between cognition and emotion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Yao","given":"Zhao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Jia"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yanyan"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhenhong"}],"citation-key":"yao_2017_norms","container-title":"Behavior Research Methods","container-title-short":"Behav Res","DOI":"10.3758/s13428-016-0793-2","ISSN":"1554-3528","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8]]},"language":"en","page":"1374-1385","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Norms of valence, arousal, concreteness, familiarity, imageability, and context availability for 1,100 Chinese words","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.3758/s13428-016-0793-2","volume":"49"},

The species of genus Ferula mostly grows in mountainous regions and some are distributed in arid climates. Various species of Ferula have been reported from USSR, Pakistan, India and western Himalayas. Some species of the genus are commonly used as spices. Some of species of genus Ferula are used in the preparation of local drugs. These plants are also known to be a rich source of gum-resin used in folklore medicine. The genus Ferula is mostly characterized by the presence of sesquiterpenes and sesquiterpene coumarins. The genus Ferula has long been regarded as a monophyletic genus because its members are similar in habit and morphology but recent molecular studies stated that there is a controversy on both upper and lower level classification of the genus Ferula. The molecular studies concluded that Ferula group including Dorema, Leutea and Ferula is in the tribe Scandiceae, based on ITS sequence analysis. It was found that Dorema and Leutea arise from within a paraphyletic Ferula and suggested nomenclatural changes. This review mainly focuses on the distribution and taxonomy of the medicinally economic important genus Ferula.","author":[{"family":"Yaqoob","given":"Ubaid"},{"family":"Nawchoo","given":"Irshad Ahmad"}],"citation-key":"yaqoob_2016_distribution","container-title":"Journal of Botany","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"language":"en","page":"9","source":"Zotero","title":"Distribution and Taxonomy of Ferula L","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},

  {"id":"yeung_2023_concepta","abstract":"This essay considers the Cantophone as a subject(-to-come) of literary history foreclosed by Sinophone statelessness. Cantonese, historically marginalized in Sinitic literacy and subjected to compradorial colonialism, highlights the complexity of topolectal representation beyond the “local vs. national” binary. This is further compounded by the Cantonese-speaking diaspora and the global cultural industry, owing much to the historical status of Hong Kong as a colonial city on the periphery of China and an Asian outpost of Cold War liberalism. The Cantophone suggests a topolect-based literary-cultural system eccentrically centered upon Hong Kong, existing in negotiated entwinement with the logics of state-authorized orthographies, sinographic or alphabetic. As a non-sovereign space, Hong Kong nonetheless informs, beyond its spatial border, a Cantonese-based cultural archipelago even while it negotiates its formal dependence on Anglophone and Sinophone literary capitals. Instead of considering “dialectal literature” (fangyan wenxue) as a subset of national literature, this essay analyzes in four parts the literary politics of topolectal representation as played out within what the author calls the “colonial-classical-national-local” intellectual-historical matrix. To the extent that writing Cantonese is a textual performance independent from the category of the locally-embodied “native speaker,” the essay suggests that topolectal misfit within different orthographic orders far exceeds the questions of Sinophone place-making; it sustains both a non-national alternative to retell sinographic literary history, and an inscription of epistemological difference within/out “Chineseness” as a postcolonial ethnocultural identity. As a thought-experiment, the Cantophone is an invitation to an exercise in thinking literary history without the One-ness of nation-states.","author":[{"family":"Yeung","given":"Wayne C.

  {"id":"yingsheng_2019_open","abstract":"The first section of this article begins by investigating the term “going down to the Western Oceans” (xia xiyang 下西洋), which was used as early as the time of Zheng He. It also discusses the origin of the concepts of the Eastern and Western Oceans. The second section discusses the influx of overseas geographical knowledge into China before the time of Zheng He, especially over two important periods: first, the coming of Indian geographical knowledge along with Buddhism to China from the Wei-Jin period (220–420 ce), and second, the advent of Islamic geographical knowledge during the Mongol-Yuan period (ca. 1206–1368). The third section discusses the contributions of foreign members in Zheng He’s fleet, especially fanhuozhang 番火長 (foreign pilot). Through an analysis of the records of three military encounters—the suppression of the pirate Chen Zuyi 陳祖義, the attack on Ceylon, and the battle with pirates on a return journey—we find that the term fanhuozhang appears in all three cases, showing that foreign experts were commonly present in all branches or segments of Zheng He’s fleet, and that it must have been their job to navigate in the Indian ocean portion of the journey. Based on these findings, the author suggests that even before the beginning of Ming, Chinese people had developed an understanding of navigation technology and absorbed expertise from other peoples, and that this knowledge formed the technological foundation of Zheng He’s long-distance voyages, evident of the fact that China’s ancient navigational technology was an open knowledge system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Yingsheng","given":"Liu"}],"citation-key":"yingsheng_2019_open","container-title":"China and Asia","container-title-short":"China Asia","DOI":"10.1163/2589465X-00101003","ISSN":"2589-4641, 2589-465X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,11]]},"language":"en","page":"50-91","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"An Open Knowledge System for Navigational Science: Zheng He’s Maritime Expeditions and Sino-Foreign Overseas Exchange","title-short":"An Open Knowledge System for Navigational Science","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://brill.com/view/journals/cahs/1/1/article-p50_50.xml","volume":"1"},

We conducted a case analysis of how war metaphors are framed to address various societal issues in a corpus of public speeches by Hong Kong government officials. By investigating patterns of lexical choices under the source domain of WAR and the underlying reasons for the source-target domain mappings (i.e. Mapping Principles), we found that the target domain of social issues in Hong Kong is primarily conceptua­ lized in terms of a combat frame, and governmental issues are primarily talked about in terms of a protection frame, both of which are positively evaluated. Additionally, economic issues are primarily addressed in terms of a strategy frame, which is both positively and negatively evaluated.

  {"id":"zenner_2019_social","abstract":"The use of loanwords is not merely a lexical act (filling a lexical gap in a given language, or using a shorter word in place of a longer expression) but also a socially meaningful one – a contextual expression of self, social identity and language regard. Recent lexical borrowing research has drawn attention to this social meaning potential of loanwords. What motivates language users to select a borrowed form over a receptor language equivalent, what is the (perceived) social meaning of this choice and how can we empirically address these questions? This special issue seeks to bring into debate the interface between speakers (the social dimension) and language (the linguistic dimension) with regard to lexical borrowing, and to probe how language regard and speaker identity influence and explain the use of loanwords. In a bid to better understand this complex interface, the special issue includes papers that explore a range of empirical methodologies drawn from different subfields of (socio)linguistics and closely related scientific domains (linguistic anthropology, conversation analysis, corpus linguistics, social psychology and psycholinguistics) and documents a variety of contact situations: English loans into French and Finnish, Māori loanwords into New Zealand English, German loans into Dutch. Together, the different perspectives presented in this issue help advance our understanding of the relationship between lexical change on the one hand, and language regard and (social) identity on the other hand.","author":[{"family":"Zenner","given":"Eline"},{"family":"Rosseel","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Calude","given":"Andreea Simona"}],"citation-key":"zenner_2019_social","container-title":"Ampersand","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amper.2019.100055","ISSN":"2215-0390","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"100055","title":"The social meaning potential of loanwords: Empirical explorations of lexical borrowing as expression of (social) identity","type":"Journal Article","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215039019300608","volume":"6"},

The first important finding is related to the directionality of synaesthetic transfers, that is, the transfer direction is mostly from the gustatory sense to both tactile and olfactory senses, and from the tactile sense to the olfactory sense, while the reverse direction is rare. Another interesting tendency is the priority of synaesthesia over the embodied metaphor.

  {"id":"zhao_2018_synaesthesiaa","abstract":"Linguistic synaesthesia involving description of one sensory modality in terms of concepts from another sensory modality, such as sweet voice and 冷色 leng3 se4 'cold color', is employed across discourse types (i.e., poetic and ordinary), time periods (i.e., synchronic and diachronic), and language families (e.g., Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, and Semitic). The kind of language use has, however, not received much attention in linguistic research, although manifesting as mapping from one bodily domain to another bodily domain would pose challenges to Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the theory of embodiment. This thesis thus aimed to conduct a systematic and comprehensive lexical semantic study on linguistic synaesthesia of Mandarin sensory adjectives from a corpus-based approach, to explore the tendencies of Mandarin synaesthesia, and to examine the theoretical implications of linguistic synaesthesia. This study proposed a linguistic synaesthesia identification procedure (LSIP) to extract synaesthetic data for Mandarin sensory adjectives from the Sinica corpus, which was adapted from Pragglejaz Group (2007)'s well-established metaphor identification procedure (MIP). The proposed identification procedure for linguistic synaesthesia was demonstrated to be also applicable to other languages from other corpora. Based on the distribution of the collected synaesthetic usages of Mandarin sensory adjectives, the study found that Mandarin synaesthesia exhibited directionality mapping from more embodied senses to less embodied ones, analogous to the attested patterns of linguistic synaesthesia in Indo-European, Hebrew, and Indonesian languages. The directionality of Mandarin synaesthesia is, however, tendencies-based. In addition, Mandarin synaesthesia was attested to show language-specific characteristics when compared to the established tendencies of English synaesthesia, hence inconsistent with the proposal of cross-lingual universality of synaesthetic patterns. The distribution and directionality of Mandarin synaesthesia demonstrated that neither the embodiment account nor the biological association account of linguistic synaesthesia could be fully supported. The thesis thus suggested an incorporated theoretical model containing both embodiment mechanisms and biological mechanisms, to account for the synaesthetic tendencies of Mandarin sensory adjectives and the language-specific characteristics of linguistic synaesthesia in Mandarin Chinese. Besides, this study has shown that linguistic synaesthesia is a type of metaphor as a linguistic realization of conceptual metaphors, which should be taken into consideration by Conceptual Metaphor Theory. The thesis therefore argued for a finer-grained account of embodiment covering the notions of the degree of embodiment and the type of embodied events, to refine Conceptual Metaphor Theory and the theory of embodiment.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingqing"}],"citation-key":"zhao_2018_synaesthesiaa","event-place":"Hong Kong","genre":"Ph.D.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"publisher":"The Hong Kong Polytechnic University","publisher-place":"Hong Kong","title":"Synaesthesia, Metaphor, and Cognition: A Corpus-Based Study on Synaesthetic Adjectives in Mandarin Chinese","type":"thesis","URL":"https://theses.lib.polyu.edu.hk/handle/200/9509"},

Based on this set of less-studied data, we find that Mandarin synesthesia does not share the same directionality tendencies with linguistic synesthesia in Indo-European languages, which challenges the assumed cross-linguistic universality of these transfer patterns. Based on the corpus data, we demonstrate that there are three types of directional tendencies for Mandarin synesthesia: unidirectional, biased-directional, and bidirectional. Unidirectional synesthesia is rule-based, while synesthesia that is biased in one direction is frequency-based. In contrast, bidirectional synesthesia shows no directional preference. Thus, the directionality of linguistic synesthesia cannot be interpreted as rule-based or frequency-based exclusively. In addition, this study finds that linguistic synesthesia shows language-specific variations for directionality tendencies grounded in both embodiment and neural mechanisms, which challenges the theory that linguistic synesthesia is a bio-neurologically based linguistic realization. Lastly, the fact that linguistic synesthesia involves both rule-based and frequency-based transfer directionalities suggests that the relationship between linguistic synesthesia and metaphor merits further exploration.","author":[{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qingqing"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"},{"family":"Ahrens","given":"Kathleen"}],"citation-key":"zhao_2019_directionality","container-title":"Lingua","DOI":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lingua.2019.102744","ISSN":"0024-3841","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"page":"102744","title":"Directionality of Linguistic Synesthesia in Mandarin: A Corpus-based Study","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384119304930","volume":"232"},

  {"id":"zhao_2022_linguistic","abstract":"This study seeks to clarify the nature of linguistic synesthesia using a lexical-conceptual account. Based on a lexical analysis of Mandarin synesthetic usages, we find that (1) linguistic synesthesia maps the metaphorical meaning between two domains; and (2) linguistic synesthetic mappings and conceptual metaphoric mappings have similar behaviors when sense modalities are treated as conceptual domains that contain a set of mappings constrained by Mapping Principles. This lexical-conceptual account is designed to capture the fact that linguistic synesthesia involves mapping between lexicalized concepts of sensory properties, instead of the real-time sensory input that is processed in neurological synesthesia. The incorporation of a lexical semantic view with the framework of Conceptual Metaphor Theory not only offers a coherent and comprehensive account for the nature of linguistic synesthesia, but also handles aspects of linguistic synesthesia previously only accounted for by nonmetaphorical accounts. These design features make this proposal the most comprehensive account to fit the current data.

  {"id":"zhong_2018_pleasing","abstract":"Description of flavours of desserts often involves a rich range of vocabulary. This paper investigates the real-life language describing tastes of desserts in Mandarin Chinese, extracting data from Dazhong Dianping, the most popular restaurant review website in China. Using the Sketch Engine as the primary tool to extract collocations, we found that ‘mouthfeel’ and ‘personality’, instead of direct descriptions of TASTE or SMELL, are the most dominant expressions. In particular, more than one hundred ‘mouthfeel’ words are identified, with strong tendency of positive polarity. The majority of ‘mouthfeel’ terms are tactile (sense of touch) in nature, which shall be considered as synaesthetic metaphors to depict TASTE. Moreover, these ‘mouthfeel’ words often collocate with words connoting pleasant personality, especially in terms of warm social interactions. In summary, due to its intensional rather than physical telicity, description of desserts shows significant cultural variations. On the one hand, the preferred words still retain the same telic purpose, i.e., to please the mouth; on the other hand, instead of using expressions conveying intensional bodily pleasure (sensuality/sexuality), Chinese focus both on the parochial bodily experience (pleasing the mouth) as well as the social-interactional (pleasant personality) to describe desserts.","author":[{"family":"Zhong","given":"Yin"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"zhong_2018_pleasing","container-title":"Proceedings of the 32nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation: 25th Joint Workshop on Linguistics and Language Processing","event-place":"Hong Kong","event-title":"32nd Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"page":"893-903","publisher":"ACL","publisher-place":"Hong Kong","title":"Pleasing to the Mouth of Pleasant Personality: A Corpus-based Study of Conceptualization of Desserts in Online Chinese Food Reviews","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"zhong_2023_entity","abstract":"Abstract\n            Nouns in human languages mostly profile concrete and abstract entities. But how much eventive information can be found in nouns? Will such eventive information found in sensory nouns have anything to do with the cognitive representation of the basic human senses? Importantly, is there any ontological and/or cognitive motivation that can account for this noun–verb dichotomy via body-and-world interactions? This study presents the first comprehensive investigation of sensory nouns in Mandarin Chinese, examining their qualia structures formalised in the Generative Lexicon Theory, as well as the time-dependent (endurant–perdurant) properties encoded in their sensory modalities. This study fills the gap in sensorial studies by highlighting the pivotal position of nouns in sensory experiences and provides insights into the interactions between perception, cognition, and language. Further, it establishes, for the first time, the cognitive motivation of the categorial noun–verb bifurcation without presupposing any a priori knowledge of grammatical categories.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhong","given":"Yin"},{"family":"Ahrens","given":"Kathleen"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Chu-Ren"}],"citation-key":"zhong_2023_entity","container-title":"Humanities and Social Sciences Communications","container-title-short":"Humanit Soc Sci Commun","DOI":"10.1057/s41599-023-01677-z","ISSN":"2662-9992","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,22]]},"language":"en","page":"255","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Entity, event, and sensory modalities: An onto-cognitive account of sensory nouns","title-short":"Entity, event, and sensory modalities","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-023-01677-z","volume":"10"},

Here, we uncover systematic ways in which word similarities estimated by cosine over BERT embeddings are understated and trace this effect to training data frequency. We ﬁnd that relative to human judgements, cosine similarity underestimates the similarity of frequent words with other instances of the same word or other words across contexts, even after controlling for polysemy and other factors. We conjecture that this underestimation of similarity for high frequency words is due to differences in the representational geometry of high and low frequency words and provide a formal argument for the two-dimensional case.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"Kaitlyn"},{"family":"Ethayarajh","given":"Kawin"},{"family":"Card","given":"Dallas"},{"family":"Jurafsky","given":"Dan"}],"citation-key":"zhou_2022_problems","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:2205.05092","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Problems with Cosine as a Measure of Embedding Similarity for High Frequency Words","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05092"},

We ﬁnd that countries whose names occur with low frequency in training corpora are more likely to be tokenized into subwords, are less semantically distinct in embedding space, and are less likely to be correctly predicted: e.g., Ghana (the correct answer and invocabulary) is not predicted for, “The country producing the most cocoa is [MASK].”. Although these performance discrepancies and representational harms are due to frequency, we ﬁnd that frequency is highly correlated with a country’s GDP; thus perpetuating historic power and wealth inequalities.

  {"id":"zohar_2013_trends","abstract":"Abstract\n            Perfumes have been known as utilizable but exclusive products since antiquity. Use of aromatic substances was first mentioned in archaic sources of the ancient world. The origin of such fragrant substances was mainly vegetable and animal. Throughout history, the use of subtle perfumes increased and some of the exotic materials became expensive and valuable commodities. They were the source of wealth for cultures and rulers. The contribution of the Arabs to the distribution of new crops, knowledge, industrial techniques and substances is a well-known phenomenon. In our article we intend to focus on the new perfumes that were distributed throughout the world thanks to the Arab conquests and the knowledge of their other uses, mainly medicinal, that was handed down along with the products themselves. About 20 common perfumes are known to have been used in the medieval world, though half of them were not mentioned in earlier sources.\n            These phenomena will be dealt with and presented in a profile we built up for four perfumes: agarwood, camphor, musk and ambergris. The theoretical and practical uses of these perfumes that are presented in detail (based on various sources including traders’ documents, medical literature and practical Genizah fragments, dealing mainly with medicine) will serve as case studies for the understanding of new trends in the uses of perfumes after the Muslim conquest. Arab perfumes can be divided into three groups, according to their level of importance:\n            \n              A.\n              New perfumes, mainly from the vast region named “India”; most of which (such as camphor, ambergris and sandalwood and a compound made out of them known as\n              nadd\n              and\n              ghāliya\n              ) were not known in the Middle East and the Mediterranean region until the Muslim conquests.\n            \n            \n              B.\n              Perfumes that kept their popularity including: a variety of cinnamon, costus, spikenard, frankincense, saffron and rose.\n            \n            \n              C.\n              Perfumes that lost their worth like balsam and myrrh.\n            \n            It seems that camphor was the best and most cherished perfume that substituted balsam. Like balsam, the importance of myrrh that was imported from Arabia and East Africa also declined and it seems that its substitute was musk. Transformations in perfume fashion were in fact only part of a wider revolution of the Arabic material culture which the Middle East, the Mediterranean region and even many European countries experienced due to the Arab conquests.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Zohar","given":"Amar"},{"family":"Lev","given":"Efraim"}],"citation-key":"zohar_2013_trends","container-title":"Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain & Ireland","container-title-short":"J.R.

  {"id":"zurbuchen_2020_introduction","abstract":"The oldest and most extensive written language of Southeast Asia is Old Javanese, or Kawi. It is the oldest language in terms of written records, and the most extensive in the number and variety of its texts. Javanese literature has taken many forms. At various times, prose stories, sung poetry or other metrical types, chronicles, scientific, legal, and philosophical treatises, prayers, chants, songs, and folklore were all written down. Yet relatively few texts are available in English. The unstudied texts remaining are an unexplored record of Javanese culture as well as a language still alive as a literary medium in Bali. Introduction to Old Javanese Language and Literature represents a first step toward remedying the dearth of Old Javanese texts available to English-speaking students. The ideal teaching companion, this anthology offers transliterated original texts with facing-page English translations. Theanthology focuses on prose selections, since their straightforward style and syntax offer the beginning student the most rewarding experience. Four sections make up the collection. Part I offers several short readings as the most accessible entry point into Old Javanese. Part II contains two moralistic fables from an Old Javanese retelling of the Hindu Pañcatantra cycle. Part III takes up the epic, providing excerpts from one of the books of the Old Javanese retelling of the Mahabharata. Part IV offers excerpts from two chronicles, the generic conventions of which challenge received notions of history writing because of their supernaturalism and folkloric elements. Includes introduction, glossary, and notes.","author":[{"family":"Zurbuchen","given":"Mary S."}],"citation-key":"zurbuchen_2020_introduction","ISBN":"978-0-472-90218-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"publisher":"University of Michigan Press","title":"Introduction to Old Javanese language and literature: A Kawi prose anthology","type":"book"}
