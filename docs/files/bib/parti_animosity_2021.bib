  abstract = {This pilot study attempts a novel comparison on how metaphors of BITTERNESS are used in English and Mandarin Chinese, in order to identify subtle crosslinguistic differences. Using dictionary definitions and WordNet databases, we conduct a lexical semantic analysis and establish the various senses “bitter words” can convey. Then, with the help of corpus data we explore the typical themes and contexts the two languages utilize sensory words related to this concept. We observed that figurative uses of bitter in English tend to revolve around ANIMOSITY, while Chinese 苦 ku3 'bitter' frequently expresses SUFFERING. Due to the displeasing character of this human taste experience, conceptualizations of BITTERNESS are overwhelmingly negative. However, we also found that BITTERNESS does not always transmit negative polarity, expressions such as “a bitter pill to swallow” and “良藥苦口 good medicine tastes bitter” carry an evaluative positivity. Related to linguistic synaesthesia, we found that bitter in English has origins in the tactile sensory domain, and channels this modality when used as a conceptual metaphor for HARSHNESS, describing colds and winds, or sometimes words.},
