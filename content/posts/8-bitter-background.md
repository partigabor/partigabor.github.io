## 1. Bitter taste as an evolutionary tool

In human evolutionary biology, bitter taste receptors
play an important protective role, as they can detect
potentially noxious edibles (Logue, 2015, p. 48). A
great amount of natural bitter compounds found in
plants are in fact toxic. Therefore, the signalling of
poisonous food with a sharp and repulsive taste was
crucial for survival, in contrast with “useful” food
components often perceived sweet or salty (Witt,
2019). The importance of harmful food detection
is demonstrated by the fact that for salty, sour, and
sweet we have only one type of receptor for each,
while for bitter, there are no less than 25 different
kinds (Lee & Cohen, 2016). It is our most sensitive
taste primary in both senses of the word, for bitter
taste receptors are damaged easily (due to viral tracheal
and ear infections), and are also the first to fade
with aging (Bartoshuk et al., 2012). 

Unpleasant
bitter taste triggers a rejection response, and this
effect can be observed across the animal kingdom as
well. Herbivore primates prefer the younger, immature
leaves lower in toxins, as many plants have developed
chemical defence. Insecthunting
bats learn very fast that the greenish glowing of bioluminescent
fireflies means: “Don’t eat me, I taste terrible!”.
During an experiment involving some unfortunate
bats, the nocturnal animals immediately discarded
the (previously unfamiliar) chemically protected insects
after tasting them, showing strong aversive behaviour
that can be familiar to us: they salivated,
coughed, and rapidly shook their heads in a response
to the gnarly taste of the toxic fireflies which they
never attempted to catch again (Leavell et al., 2018).

Interestingly, a general negative response persists
even if the bitter taste does not pair with any level of
toxicity, meaning that animals keep away from bitter
tasting nutrients even when they are not dangerous
(Glendinning, 1994), while us humans can voluntarily
enjoy olives or broccoli, because we know they
are safe to consume.

## 2. Human taste perception of bitterness

Human perception of bitterness since evolved due to
the use of fire, various cooking techniques, our overall
change in diet, and the fact that we do not rely on
this particular method of toxin avoidance anymore.
In connection to this, scientists are reporting evidence
on the loss of function of bitter taste receptor
genes (Wang et al., 2004). Bitter substances are almost
entirely organic, such as alkaloids used in drug
and medicine production, e.g. caffeine (coffee), quinine
(tonic), nicotine (tobacco), and cocaine (coca
plant). The ethanol in alcoholic drinks carries a base
bitter taste as well (Hall & Guyton, 2016, p. 685).

Besides well documented genetic variation in bitter
taste perception, it is generally true that most people
find bitter taste unattractive (Duffy & Bartoshuk,
2000). However, in some cases, it is indeed desired
and consumed intentionally. Most importantly, human
societies consume medicinal herbs and herbal
potions for thousands of years. Traditional herbalism
– what we now consider folk medicine – marks
the dawn of the history of medicine, and gave the
basis for many modern remedies (Petrovska, 2012).
Hence the notion that bitter medicine is hard to swallow
however beneficial, and the related philosophical
twist about bitter truths. 

Popular bitter tasting
foods are also in abundance: e.g. vegetables usually
deemed healthy, such as artichokes, kale, dandelion
greens, and bitter gourd (bitter melon); fruits,
such as grapefruit, citrus peel, cocoa, and therefore
(dark) chocolate; spices, such as turmeric and galangal
(both rhizomes of two related plants). As for beverages
besides ale brewed with hops: tonic water,
gin, campari, ouzo, pastis, and other herbal bitters
are being perfected for hundreds of years now, some
of them originally marketed as health drinks, evolving
into many of the apéritifs and digestifs of today
(ToussaintSamat,
2009, pp. 166, 636). And we must
not forget the magic potion of our time: coffee.

By anecdotal evidence we all know that young
children tend to follow the primal evolutionary response
of rejection, they usually loathe the taste of
coffee and beer – not to mention the infamous Brussel
sprouts, triggering grimaces worldwide[^1]. We
might also assume that as we age, many of us –for
the lack of a better word –
learn to enjoy bitter
food. The fact is that we gradually lose the ability to
taste bitter, as taste buds change overtime (Prutkin
et al., 2000). Nerve fibres that mediate bitter taste
are sensitive and easily damaged by viruses, therefore
our perception of taste diminishes when we are
sick, say, catch a cold (L. Bartoshuk et al., 1996).
With aging, these harmful experiences accumulate
enough so that it results in the deterioration of bitter
tasting capabilities, resulting in desensitization
and diminishing our perception for it. In turn, the
flavour profile of various food items translates to
our tongue differently, making some of them enjoyable
for adults. Furthermore, our preferences change
over time through conditioning as well. Our brain
knows what our body needs (sodium, sucrose, proteins,
etc.); and if our intake fulfils its need, the dish
would be more palatable in the future. Ergo, we like
some food more and more over time (and very often
these are unhealthy foods containing large amounts
of fat, salt, sugars).

[^1]: The role of ethnicity, culture and conditioning in human
taste perception is one of the most exciting topics in the study
of taste (see Pilcher, 2012; Williams et al., 2016)
