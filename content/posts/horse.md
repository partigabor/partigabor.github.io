Notes and tips on how to check if a horse is healthy before buying one, and how to take care of it afterwards (in progress) ...

# How to buy a horse

## General suggestions

* No younger than 5 years old.
* No older than 20 years old.
* No stallions, mare or gelding is good.

## Things to look out for

### Physical health

* Skin abrasions, ekzema.
* Droopy lower lip.
* Drooling, snotting.
* Bad breath - sign of tooth decay, can be deadly. Normal horse breath should be herbal.
* Mouth and lips should be intact, damage can be sign of bad handling (wire, etc).
* Penis hanging down - could be sign of tranquilizer use (bad sign, could visit the stable unannounced)
* Limping, the gait of the front two legs and the back two should be even.
* Stiffness of the stomach - not good if always stiff.
* Muscles around the front shouldn't be too tight, breathing should go easy.
* Hair should be shiny.
* Hooves should be in good condition.
* Not too skinny, not too weak.
* If all looks good but your gut feeling says no, don't buy it.

### Mental wellbeing

* Not too jumpy, not too agressive, not too stubborn. Lively, curious, and friendly is good, afraid of people is not.
* Ask the owner to ask up the four hoofs, see how the horse behaves.
* Ask the owner to demonstrate all speeds of the horse - walk, trot, gallop - see if trained.
* See how the horse behaves at the sight of unfamiliar objects, a bucket, plastic bottle, anything - shouldn't scare easily.

## How to take care of a horse

* Clean before every saddling, check for abrasions.
* Don't feed from hand - teaches them to bite.
