## 1. The Christian faith and the Bible supplied the ideological material for the colonial exploitation of the world

>[John Paul II, we Andean and American Indians, have decided to take advantage of your visit to return to you your Bible, since in five centuries it has not given us love, peace or justice.
>Please take back your Bible and give it back to our oppressors, because they need its moral teachings more than we do. Ever since the arrival of Christofer Columbus a culture, a language, religion and values which belong to Europe have been imposed on Latin America by force.
> The Bible came to us as part of the imposed colonial transformation. It was the ideological weapon of this colonial assault. The Spanish sword which attacked and murdered the bodies of Indians by day at night became the cross which attacked the Indian soul.](https://archive.org/details/14921992voiceofv0006unse/page/66/mode/2up)[^1] [^2]

### The following excerpt is taken from Riches (2000, pp. 52--53)

"The colonization of Latin America is one of the darkest episodes in European history. In the first hundred years after Columbus’ arrival, millions of people died through war, disease, and ill-treatment. In some areas the population was reduced by 80 per cent. The Spaniards and Portuguese who colonized Central and South America were ‘given’ the land by the Pope and encouraged to convert its population. Columbus, who arrived in present-day El Salvador in 1492, believed that his mission was part of the dawning of a new age, when the whole world would be united in Christ under the Pope to enjoy the final millennium before the Last Judgement. He was fond of quoting Isaiah 65:17: ‘For I am about to create new heavens and a new earth’; and its echo in Revelation 21:1. The new age would embrace the whole earth; Mount Zion would be regained for Christianity and all would acknowledge the one true faith.

A papal decree commanded the monarchs of Spain and Portugal to wage a holy war to support this missionary endeavour. Here the narratives of the conquest of Canaan in Joshua and Judges provided support not only for conquest, but also for the merciless killing of those who refused to submit. As one contemporary commentator on the widespread deaths, Fray Toribio, put it,

>Whether or not the great sins and idolatries that took place in this land cause it [the dying], I do not know; nevertheless I see that those seven idolatrous generations that possessed the promised land were destroyed by Joshua and then the children of Israel populated it.

It is then not surprising that there have been those who have seen the Bible wholly as an instrument of oppression. When the Pope visited Peru, he received an open letter from various indigenous groups, inviting him to take back the Bible to Europe.

>John Paul II, we Andean and American Indians, have decided to take advantage of your visit to return to you your Bible, since in five centuries it has not given us love, peace, or justice. Please take back your Bible and give it back to our oppressors, because they need its moral teachings more than we do. 

Nevertheless, Latin America also saw a powerful movement arise to rescue the Bible from its colonial misuse. Even at the time of the conquistadores there were voices which appealed to the Bible against the appalling treatment of the Indians. Of course, the Bible was not needed to show that the treatment of the Indians was unjust and cruel beyond compare, but its authority could be invoked to oppose the oppressive treatment of the indigenous peoples. Bartolomé de Las Casas, the first priest ordained in the New World, a chaplain to the Spanish armies which conquered Cuba (1513), and a one-time slave-owner, became a resolute opponent of the Spanish conquest. He appealed to Sirach 34:21–6: ‘The bread of the needy is the life of the poor; whoever deprives them of it, is a man of blood. To take away a neighbour’s living is to murder him; to deprive an employee of his wages is to shed blood.’ In his sermon at Pentecost in 1514, he asserted that an offering made to God without the practice of justice was stained with the blood of the poor: ‘Like one who kills a son before his father’s eyes is the man who offers a sacrifice from the property of the poor.’ He was eventually ordered to withdraw to a monastery, attacked by his enemies as a heretic, and had his confessional withdrawn by the Emperor Charles V. Subsequently, Philip II of Spain approved measures to confiscate his works."
