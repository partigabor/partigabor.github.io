Notes and tips on how to check if a horse is healthy before buying one, how to take care of it, and what you need for riding. (In progress...)

# How to buy a horse

## General suggestions

* No younger than 5 years old.
* No older than 20 years old.
* No stallions; mare or gelding is good.

## Things to look out for

### Physical

* Overall healhty look and feel.
* Skin abrasions, ekzema.
* Droopy lower lip.
* Drooling, snotting.
* Bad breath - sign of tooth decay, can be deadly. Normal horse breath should smell herbal.
* Mouth and lips should be intact, damage can be sign of bad handling (wire, etc).
* Penis hanging down - could be sign of tranquilizer use (bad sign, might visit the stable unannounced to mitigate this)
* Limping, the gait of the front two legs and the back two should be even.
* Stiffness of the stomach - not good if always stiff.
* Muscles around the front shouldn't be too tight, breathing should go easy.
* Horse throwing itself to the ground - bad sign, might have kólika
* Hair should be shiny.
* Hooves should be in good condition.
* Not too skinny, not too weak.
* If all looks good but your gut feeling says no, don't buy.

### Mental

* Not too jumpy, not too agressive, not too stubborn. Lively, curious, and friendly is good, afraid of people is not.
* Ask the owner to request the four hooves, see how the horse behaves.
* Ask the owner to demonstrate all speeds of the horse - walk, trot, gallop - see if trained well.
* See how the horse behaves at the sight of unfamiliar objects, a bucket, plastic bottle, car, anything - shouldn't scare easily.
* Interact with the horse, see if you match.

## How to take care of a horse

### General

* Never feed from hand! It teaches them to bite. (Horses are not pets or predators, they do not depend on you giving food.)
* Never hurt the horse, but it's ok if the horse thinks you *could* hurt it. They will test your dominance every now and then, and you have to be firm.
* Body language is primary, voice is secondary. 
* 

### Riding

* Brush before every saddling, check for abrasions, clean off sweat.
* Use cream on skin if irritated, don't saddle if skin is damaged.
* Pick hoof before every ride, check for little rocks. (From the sides, turning towards the back of the horse so they cannot kick you.)
* Put on bridle from the side, not from the front (The horse can headbutt you accidentally.)
* Take off bridle if stopping for a longer time, don't leave it on. (They can step on it and break the reins.)
* Wash snaffle bit after every ride, don't wet the leather. Can help with thumb in mouth corner if horse doesn't wanna open.
