[![The flag of Grenada](/images/grenada.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Grenada)

I was drawing flags ever since I was a kid, and all my life I thought that the Grenadian flag has tiny little flame. Now, after spending 3 years on a PhD thesis about spices, I found out that the flag features an open [nutmeg](https://partigabor.github.io/spice/book/materials/nutmeg/) fruit (*Myristica fragrans*), for its important role in the island's economy
