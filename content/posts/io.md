# What is the .io domain name and why is it problematic?

Preferred by tech companies, the .io domain name does not actually refer to the input-output word pair (I/O) we all learned about in primary school. I still remember that IT teacher - Gyuri bácsi - with the black mustache and white lab-coat trying to calm us down when the first Windows 98 PCs arrived. We suddenly got slapped in the face by the ever-accelerating pace of technology and subsequently forgot all our (very limited) MS-DOS skills. The last Linux machines were left behind in the old számtechterem[^1], jinxing the future towards a world more inhumane, ruled by for-profit tech companies.

This controversial .io is in fact a country code top-level domain assigned to the *British Indian Ocean Territory*. Yeah... colonies. There are seven atolls of hundreds of little islands south of India, around halfway between Zanzibar (Tanzania) and Sumatra (Indonesia), called the [Chagos Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagos_Archipelago). The local population, the [Chagossians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagossians) were [forcefully expelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Chagossians) from the archipelago between 1968 and 1973 by the UK government, who wanted to make space for building a military base there joint with the United States. Today, UK and US military personnal are the only inhabitants, operating the [base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Thunder_Cove). Tourists, journalists, or Chagossians are not allowed to enter.

Recently, Mauritius is trying to obtain control over the islands in a decolonization campaign through legal proceedings against the UK in various international courts. After some nominal Mauritian success, a flag raising ceremony was held but it was immediatly [met with protest](https://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2022-02-14/chagos-islanders-living-in-sussex-criticise-problematic-flag-raising) by Chagos Islanders living in the UK.

Chagossian refugees now mostly live in Mauritius, the Seychelles, and the UK. They are still trying to go home, but a [ban on their return](https://newint.org/features/web-exclusive/2016/07/05/uk-supreme-court-highlights-right-of-chagos-refugees-to-return) remains in place. And, of course, they do not receive any funds from the profits made from the popular .io domain name.[^2]

[^2]: The island nation of Tuvalu gains significant portions of its GDP from the .tv domain name. They are saving funds from this income to buy land/move on to be a digital state, since Tuvalu will be one of the first countries to be entirely underwater in the near future due to climate change and rising sea levels. {{< details "more on Tuvalu..." close >}}{{< youtube JQefASJhY2E >}}{{< /details >}}
