Welcome! My name is Gábor Parti,[^1] I am a linguist and philologist. In mz research I am using digital technologies in philological and humanities research. I am interested in linguistic and cultural exchange along historic trade routes in Asia, especially around the Indian Ocean world and the Maritime Silk Road. My focus is on how to collect, store, process, analyze, and present humanities data in new and exciting ways. I am fascinated by etymology, pre-modern travel, and data science.

[^1]: {{< typography font="Noto Sans" size="18px" >}} [ˈpɒrti ˈɡaːbor] {{< /typography >}} In Hungarian name order, the family name comes first. In English, the order is reversed. Therefore, my name is Parti Gábor in Hungarian, and Gábor Parti in English.

I am a fresh Ph.D. graduate and a postdoctoral fellow at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). At [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/study/research-postgraduate-programme/phd-or-mphil-study), I have studied corpus linguistics, computational linguistics, and I also learned about various techniques in natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and dash of data science. Previously I have received training in traditional philology from various departments at the [Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)](https://www.btk.elte.hu/en/) in Budapest, including Semitic and Arabic studies, Korean studies, Islamic studies, and Indology.

My Ph.D. dissertation is titled *Mapping the Language of Spices: A Corpus-Based, Philological Study on the Words of the Spice Domain*, and it aims to be a linguistic account of the items of the spice trade. It is about spices and spice names, their diffusion around the globe, and the relationship between materials and words. The project was supervised by [Prof. Chu-Ren Huang](https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/persons/chu-ren-huang), and funded by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html) from the [Research Grants Council (RGC)](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc/) of the Hong Kong SAR. The dissertation is also accompanied by an online database, the [Spice & Spice Terminology Database 1.2](https://partigabor.github.io/spice/). The dissertation was subsequently awarded with a *Distinguished Thesis Award* on faculty level, and it was published in *Sino-Platonic Papers* ([no. 338](https://www.sino-platonic.org/)) edited by [Prof. Victor Mair](https://ealc.sas.upenn.edu/people/victor-h-mair).
