Welcome! I am a fresh Ph.D. graduate at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), and I am using digital technologies in philological and humanities research. I am interested in linguistic and cultural exchange along historic trade routes in Asia, especially around the Indian Ocean world and the Maritime Silk Road. My focus is on how to collect, store, process, analyze, and present humanities data in new and exciting ways. I am fascinated by etymology, pre-modern travel and trade, and network theory.

I have received training in traditional philology from various departments at the [Eötvös Loránd University (ELTE)](https://www.btk.elte.hu/en/) in Budapest, including Semitic and Arabic studies, Korean studies, Islamic studies, and Indology. In Hong Kong, I have studied corpus linguistics and computational linguistics at [PolyU](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cbs/study/research-postgraduate-programme/phd-or-mphil-study), and I also learned about various techniques in natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and dash of data science.

My PhD dissertation is titled *Mapping the Language of Spices: A Corpus-Based, Philological Study on the Words of the Spice Domain*, and it aims to be a linguistic account of the spice trade. It is about spices and spice names, and their diffusion around the globe, supervised by [Prof. Chu-Ren Huang](http://www.churenhuang.com/), and funded by the [Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)](https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html). The dissertation is accompanied by an online database I am currently working on, the [Spice & Spice Terminology Database 1.0](https://partigabor.github.io/spice/).
